"(M) MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE"
"(M) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT"
"(M) 16TH AUGUST 1995"
"(M) NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME ""SCENE OMITTED"" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY."
"(S) INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT"
"(N) We're in a large closet. JACK KIEFER, an athletic American in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen."
"(N) The television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet. The TV image is in black and white. JACK shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while"
"(M) ON THE SCREEN"
"(N) A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room. Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T- shirt. There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the room behind him. A legend:"
"(N) KASIMOV is sobbing. Uncontrollably. A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather. The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out. ANATOLY looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him. KASIMOV does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY. They speak in Russian which is subtitled."
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us."
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) (M) (sobbing) I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun."
"(N) ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room. A WOMAN lies half under the sheets. She's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood. She's dead. ANATOLY lifts her eyelid."
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her! I didn't lay a finger on her."
"(N) ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN."
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Kasimov. Don't flounder."
"(M) IN THE CLOSET"
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Jesus, she's been under too long. Come on, come on! "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) You're the only one who can help me. "
"(N) Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket. But ANATOLY hits his hand away and smacks him around the head. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) JACK reacts. "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN"
"(N) ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) They'll kill me. "
"(N) ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) You asked for my help. You asked for my help...come on... "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) You're right, of course. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) JACK leans forward. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) The name pal...give us the name. "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) The contact in Minsk..the contact in Minsk..works in a travel agency. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Come on! "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Come on! "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Got him. "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(N) Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder as if he had just anointed him. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross checks -- ""MIEDIEV"" comes up, then ""posting/American consulate/Kiev."" "
"(N) JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic and virtually no bottom. She quickly leaves. "
"(S) INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot glasses. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Now, we drink. "
"(N) He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. "
"(C) ANATOLY (CONT'D)"
"(D) To friends. "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) Yes, Anatoly, yes. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Cheers. "
"(N) He drinks. He blinks. Something felt funny about that. Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY moves to the closet door and opens it. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) ANATOLY reaches up to his face --"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (in English now) Get rid of this scum. "
"(N) ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the dead woman's thigh. He checks her pulse again, checking a stopwatch. In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. "
"(N) CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her mouth. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Did we get it? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We got it. On your feet. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I want to sleep. Can I sleep here. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Walk, just walk. Start walking. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I'm walking. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Talking's good, walking's better. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Sleeping's better. "
"(N) JACK comes into the room from the closet. He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring. ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing. She looks up at him questioningly. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Oh yeah? "
"(N) JACK comes into the room from the closet. He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring. ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing. She looks up at him, questioningly. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Claire. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jack. "
"(N) She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger. ETHAN notices. He turns and SHOUTS to the room at large. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Just waiting for you, tubs. "
"(N) He walks across the room and out the door. CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring. "
"(N) We move in on it --"
"(M) CUT TO: "
"(S) INT. JET - DAY"
"(N) The pilot's voice makes an announcement. "
"(C) VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be arriving in Prague right on schedule. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? "
"(N) A passenger takes one. The ATTENDANT continues on. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) (M) (CONT'D) Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) No, I prefer the theatre. "
"(N) A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes stilted. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Perhaps you'd choose one for me. "
"(M) AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN."
"(M) BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT"
"(N) PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the armrest, and puts the tape in. "
"(N) He presses play."
"(M) ON THE TAPE, "
"(N) the image of a man comes on. EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than tieless. But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever look away. He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) (M) (on the tape) Good morning, Mr. Phelps. The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- "
"(N) The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man in his forties. The image is herky-jerky videotape, presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks down a foreign street. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) -- a former KGB Line X officer now working the international black market selling intelligence. This morning, we learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe. "
"(N) The screen shows an image of what such a list might look like, code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) For security reasons, the NOC list is divided into two encoded halves. Golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas. This portion is useless unless combined with the second half -- the true name list that is kept in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list. I don't have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim. We're keeping it internally black. Because of its urgency, I've already sent to Prague a team selected from your usual group. "
"(N) Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) Ethan Hunt will of course be your point man, as usual. He's in Kiev; we're getting word to him now. "
"(S) INT. JET - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his tired brow. KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) As always, should you or any member of your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. This tape will self- destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim! "
"(N) PHELPS inhales deeply -- "
"(M) CUT TO: "
"(S) EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY"
"(N) SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. Another legend: "
"(M) PRAGUE "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. Can you hear me?"
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Of course I can hear you. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile (M) (eyes). Can you hear me now? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Loud and clear. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) What's going on? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) I don't know. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Why don't you take a look? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Jack...that's spying. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) That's what we do isn't it? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Jack you're so wicked. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Too wicked to have a drink later? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) I think I might just take that look. "
"(N) ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I thought I'd take some now. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) (M) (quietly, to Ethan) What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Oh? What's the problem? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Tell you what? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What problem? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) (M) (laughs) Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I guess. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Ethan, you can't burn out. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why not? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) How was Chicago? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says ""All right. Who was it? My friend Harry?"" She says no. ""Oh, it was my friend Sammy."" She says it wasn't Sammy. ""Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."" ""No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"" "
"(N) PHELPS laughs. ETHAN doesn't. The back of CLAIRE'S head is in his line of sight. "
"(C) PHELPS (CONT'D)"
"(D) Boy, you really are grim. Come here, take a look. "
"(N) He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. "
"(S) EXT. PRAGUE - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN's POV of Embassy. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN nods. "
"(C) PHELPS (CONT'D)"
"(D) Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy. See it? Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe. Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them. If they're exposed, they'll be executed. Come over here. Take a lock at this. "
"(N) ETHAN is distracted by it. "
"(M) INSERT - TELEVISION"
"(C) SENATOR WALTZER"
"(D) I'll go you one further. I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst. It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's ""black budget."" These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one -- who are these people?! We were living in a democracy the last time I checked. "
"(M) BACK TO SCENE "
"(N) ETHAN looks back at JIM. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You're going to use Walter? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) He's our guy. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) He won't be back in a hurry? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Sure. If the main character does. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? "
"(N) JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum."
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Sorry, am I interrupting? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Always. "
"(N) JACK shows the gum to ETHAN."
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Stick of gum. If you come up against a lock you can't pick -- "
"(N) Half the gum is red, the other half is green. "
"(C) JACK (CONT'D)"
"(D) Red light. Green light. Mash them together, asta lasagna. Don't get any on you -- you have five seconds. "
"(N) He offers the gum to ETHAN."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Are you gonna take it? "
"(N) CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (relenting) Give me the God damn gum. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Just don't chew it. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Thank you. "
"(M) CUT TO: "
"(S) EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT"
"(S) INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT"
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(N) PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of the elevator shaft. "
"(N) PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Ethan. Jack's inside. Window's open by twenty-three hundred. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT"
"(N) Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair that's in full swing on the second floor. "
"(C) DIPLOMAT"
"(D) How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, the Ambassador's aide. If I could just steer you through the reception line here --"
"(C) DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)"
"(D) Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the director of the National Gallery -- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? "
"(C) SENATOR WALTZER"
"(D) Of course I do. How are you, Miss Norman? "
"(N) He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so SARAH whispers something in his ear. "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) He's in pocket. Under the archway behind me. "
"(N) Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. "
"(M) UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(N) PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor. He speaks into his microphone. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Sarah, mark the package and go to two. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT"
"(N) SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Your advance team mentioned you'd want a tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead and set that up for you -- "
"(C) SENATOR WALTZER"
"(D) Terrific. Let's get going. (M) (to the Diplomat) Will you excuse us? "
"(N) He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads further into the Embassy. "
"(C) DIPLOMAT"
"(D) Uh, sir? "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT "
"(N) JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal box. He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a noise from above. He looks up and sees the elevator above him descending. "
"(N) JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him to the wall. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Great. Come on. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT "
"(N) As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse. But as she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head. He never notices. They move on and down the flight of stairs. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Hannah. He's marked. Lets go. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT"
"(N) On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. "
"(C) HANNAH"
"(D) En route. "
"(N) She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the party below. She pushes a micro switch on the side of her glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the lenses. "
"(C) PHELPS (O/S)"
"(D) Hannah, pull the shade (M) (or - Hannah go to night vision). "
"(N) the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands out. That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green where SARAH sprayed it. "
"(S) INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT"
"(N) He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor. A sign in front of it says ""Out of Order."" They head for it anyway. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Governor's in position. We have the elevator. "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Excuse me, can I help you? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) -- which leads directly to the Denied Area, the only limited access area in the whole facility. "
"(N) SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. "
"(C) SARAH (CONT'D)"
"(D) As you can see. this area has both a Marine guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all times. "
"(N) She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside. The panel lights up and flashes a message -- ""ACCESS DENIED."" SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. "
"(C) SARAH (CONT'D)"
"(D) (M) (covering) Senator, don't you have a young man on your staff named JACK? "
"(N) She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jack? I believe we did have a young man named Jack. Not a reliable man, as I recall. Constantly late or behind in his work. "
"(N) Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed access, comes closer to them. "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Excuse me, let me see that ID again! "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT"
"(N) JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening to their conversation. "
"(C) PHELPS (O.S.)"
"(D) Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing. "
"(C) ETHAN (O.S.)"
"(D) (M) (with the Senator's southern accent) We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on it. "
"(N) He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of circuitry. He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download."
"(M) THE LAPTOP"
"(N) there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID picture. JACK downloads her file into the security computer. "
"(S) INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT"
"(N) Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the thumbprint analyzer once more. The panel glows, this time the message flashes -- "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Oh. Sorry, sir. "
"(N) He snaps a salute. ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and the doors close behind them. "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT"
"(N) JACK looks down at the elevator below. Through a grating, he can see them inside. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) The drink (M) (date) with Sarah is definitely off. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(N) PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's view of the party on his video monitors. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) (M) (a touch of impatience) Hannah -- I'm blind again. Hannah. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT"
"(C) HANNAH"
"(D) He's heading to the denied area. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) This work room is filled with combination lock filing cabinets and various computer terminals. ETHAN hands SARAH his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them upside down on top of a filing cabinet. "
"(N) ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, switching several times. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (to Sarah) Higher. Higher. "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Higher. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Right, right. Good. "
"(N) SARAH adjusts the glasses. "
"(M) THROUGH THE GLASSES, "
"(N) the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but clear. Anyone sitting there will be recorded. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already moving up. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jack we're in position. "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are waiting for it to arrive. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jack. Jack. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) I didn't touch it. "
"(N) The elevator stops, the doors open -- "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(N) PHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with GOLITSYN inside. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) (M) (tension rising) He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one GOLITSYN is about to step off of! ETHAN looks around, for a place to hide. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors. "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) What about my coat? I'll freeze. "
"(C) JACK (O.S.)"
"(D) I don't have it. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT "
"(N) PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Opening the doors. Go under. "
"(N) He jabs ENTER on his keyboard. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft beyond. ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space below the work room floor. Above them, the elevator continues its descent, with them hiding below. The elevator drops to just over their heads and stops. "
"(S) INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, downloading the vital information. "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT"
"(N) Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, starting to reverse it. He checks his Visco wrist monitor as GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft. He smiles and speaks into a microphone. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) He's got it. Saved your ass again Jack. "
"(C) JACK (O.S.)"
"(D) Give me a break, Pops. "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Such a nice ass. "
"(C) JACK (O.S.)"
"(D) And a lonely ass. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes. "
"(C) CLAIRE (O.S.)"
"(D) Roger that. "
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT"
"(N) Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base of the elevator shaft. "
"(S) EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT"
"(N) JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment. But as he pulls the final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes and SPARKS. "
"(S) EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT"

"(S) EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT"

"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Cut the power. Cut the power Jack. Do you hear me."
"(S) INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT"
"(N) On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get the thing to stop."
"(N) He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster. He looks up. The roof of the building is nearly upon him. ETHAN (O.S.) Come on, Jack, come on."
"(N) JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his hands, he SCREAMS --"
"(S) EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was JACKÃ­S signal."

"(N) Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is still racing to meet ETHAN. But he stops suddenly, as if hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening gloom."
"(S) EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPÃ­S voice over the monitor."
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) The package is in the open."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jim. Jim. HeÃ­s in the open."
"(C) PHELPS (O.S.)"

"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Can you lose him?"
"(C) PHELPS (O.S.)"
"(D) No. Abort."
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Ethan. HeÃ­s out of pocket. "

"(S) INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT"
"(N) Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN argue."

"(D) No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!"
"(S) EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT"
"(N) Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Sarah eye on the package. Jim, IÃ­m coming to you."

"(N) HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle."
"(S) EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs."
"(C) PHELPS (O.S.)"
"(D) Where are you?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) About two hundred yards from the bridge."
"(C) PHELPS (O.S.)"
"(D) TheyÃ­re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications. "
"(N) ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge. Past CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car. He looks on his monitor and again sees PHELPSÃ­ POV. Only ominous silence. Phelps is looking back over his shoulder. The bridge is deserted."
"(S) EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT"
"(N) SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where a cobblestone promenade runs along the river. He disappears into the fog at the edge of the river."
"(S) EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN checks his monitor again."
"(M) THE MONITOR"
"(N) The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down to a bloody hole in his own chest."
"(N) His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge and makes the long, hard fall into the river below. EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) JIM!"
"(S) EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT"
"(N) He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereÃ­s no sign of PHELPS."
"(N) ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming obscured in the gathering fog."
"(N) He turns and looks to the embankment. He can faintly see GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade. ETHAN gives chase."
"(S) EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIREÃ­S outline, visible in the driverÃ­s seat. But as he descends the stairs --"
"(N) The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) CLAIRE!"
"(N) He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a stunned CROWD starts to gather."
"(S) EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT"
"(N) SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees GOLITSYN again, slowing down. A MAN comes out of the fog an seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light."
"(N) SARAH draws closer. Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to be hanging with her for some reason."
"(S) EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN continues towards the embankment."
"(S) EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT"
"(N) SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN. Suddenly, the MAN in front of GOLITSYN pulls him towards him. Sensing something wrong, SARAH quickens her pace. The MAN is now hunched over GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYNÃ­s pockets."
"(N) The figure finds what itÃ­s looking for -- the disk -- and takes it. SARAH comes closer --"
"(M) ANGLE"
"(N) ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment. He bursts out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees, over GOLITSYNÃ­s body. ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and GASPS."
"(N) He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death. He looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated edge."
"(M) BEHIND ETHAN"
"(M) AT THE BODIES"
"(N) SARAH goes still. ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body over and sees that it is GOLITSYN. He quickly begins rummaging through his pockets."
"(N) ETHAN hear police sirens and sees..."
"(M) ANGLE"
"(S) EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver. HeÃ­s holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a modernist cockroach. He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts of the phoneÃ­s wiring, piercing it with its little prongs."
"(N) He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneÃ­s tongue down for a second, releases it and listens. He has a dial tone. Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart."
"(N) After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side."
"(C) FLAT VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Satcom seven."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Central Europe. Unsecured."
"(C) FLAT VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Designator?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Bravo Echo one one."
"(C) FLAT VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Switching."
"(N) There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the line."
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) This is Kittridge."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Go secure."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) TheyÃ­re dead."
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) WhoÃ­s dead?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donÃ­t know KITTRIDGE (M) (O.S.) Are you damaged?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) They knew we were coming. GolitsynÃ­s dead too. The disk is gone."
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) Are you intact?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Do you read me? The list is in the open!"
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?"
"(N) ETHAN closes his eyes. KITTRIDGEÃ­S voice is strong and reassuring and he needs that right now."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I donÃ­t think so."
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) DonÃ­t think, be sure. Are you clean?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Yes."
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) Location green. One hour. IÃ­ll be there myself."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) YouÃ­re in Prague?"
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) Heard a lot about you, Hunt. DonÃ­t disappoint me."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) No sir."
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) One hour."
"(N) He hangs up. ETHAN does the same. He stares at the phone for a moment, thinking. He checks his watch."
"(S) EXT. STREET - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street. Every face seems to be starring at him now, every sound is menacing. He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd."
"(S) EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering, gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by residential buildings."
"(N) Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace."
"(N) Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza."
"(S) INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT"
"(M) ETHAN'S POV "
"(N) ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are scattered around. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Yeah. "
"(N) He spots a stack of documents on the table."
"(N) ETHAN picks them up. There's a Canadian picture bearing ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, driver's license, etc. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Yeah. I follow you. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) We've lost enough agents for one night. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You mean I've lost enough agents for one night. "
"(N) KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, carefully: KITTRIDGE You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Who else is left? "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Yes. I see your point. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why was there another team? "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) What? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) I don't quite follow you. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Let's see if you can follow me around this room. (M) (eyes moving around the room) The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why?"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) (M) (a tight little smile) You're right. Maybe this'll save some time. "
"(N) The figures around the room have grown restless. KITTRIDGE tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out of his jacket. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as ""Max."""
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) The arms dealer. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as ""Job 314"". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. ""Golitsyn"" was a lightning rod, one of ours. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) This whole operation was a molehunt. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived. "
"(N) ETHAN stares at him levelly. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) I want to show you something, Ethan. "
"(N) He now shoves the papers across the table. They're xeroxed copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and MARGARET ETHAN HUNT. It shows a balance of $127, 000. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane... "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) Ethan, I can understand you're very upset. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) All right, enough is enough Hunt. You've bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it. You're determined to shake hands with the devil and I'm going to make sure you do it in hell. "
"(N) We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, mushing the two sides together. "
"(N) ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the table in one quick motion. As he does, he hurls the piece of gum. "
"(N) Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass. KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- "
"(N) The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish tank. A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. "
"(N) At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. "
"(S) EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the deserted square. "
"(S) EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT"
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN glances up at the stairwell. Naked light bulbs illuminate the way up. He slips off his jacket and shirt, then puts his jacket back on. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN unscrews a bulb. He crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps. He climbs to the next bulb. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT"
"(N) At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT "
"(N) In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking them as he goes. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can. He unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports. "
"(N) As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a mess. He splashes water on his face. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(N) He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching. One by one, he switches them off. "
"(M) THE LAPTOP "
"(N) JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk. ETHAN wakes it up. The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its connection. It prompts ETHAN along: "
"(M) SELECT USENET GROUP"
"(M) ETHAN TYPES IN "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Job. Job 3:14. March fourteen. Job 31 March. "
"(N) The computer replies: "
"(M) SEARCHING STRING NOT FOUND"
"(N) ETHAN tries again: "
"(N) The answer: "
"(M) SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND"
"(N) He tries a few more, quickly -- ""job,"" ""jobs,"" ""joblist.com,"" but nothing comes up. He tries something else -- ""scroll usenet groups."" "
"(N) The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed, by the hundreds. That's not going anywhere. "
"(N) ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of ""job 314"" he should add to the others on his computer screen. He MUMBLES. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Job three fourteen. Job -- (M) (a realization, the Biblical pronunciation) It's Job! "
"(N) He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and finds a Gideon Bible. He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the Bible passage ""Kings and Counsellors..."" "
"(N) He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the Internet and under the command ""Select Usenet Group"" he types: "
"(M) BIBLE"
"(N) The computer replies: "
"(M) 126 ENTRIES FOUND, SPECIFY GROUP"
"(M) ETHAN: "
"(M) BOOK OF JOB"
"(N) The computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious icons and artwork with an accompanying message: "
"(M) WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF JOB DISCUSSION GROUP. WHICH CHAPTER AND VERSE DO YOU WISH TO POST YOUR ENTRY UNDER?"
"(N) ETHAN types his answer ""Job 3:14"" and the screen presents a ""stickie"" for him to write his message on. He does: "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Max -- Goods tainted. Consider extremely hazardous. DO NOT USE. Fate will be that of kings and counsellors who built for themselves palaces now lying in ruins. Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p. "
"(M) ANGLE"
"(N) A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, his middle a hopelessly bloody mess. He looks like he's dying on his feet. ETHAN freezes, appalled. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Ethan, what are you doing? "
"(N) ETHAN tries to speak but nothing will come out. "
"(C) PHELPS (CONT'D)"
"(D) I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the bridge, and -- you weren't there. Ethan? Ethan? "
"(N) ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked and pointed at -- "
"(M) ANGLE"
"(N) It's CLAIRE. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What are you doing here?! "
"(N) CLAIRE freezes, her hands half-raised. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) (M) (carefully) Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Don't move. "
"(N) Her right hand has moved a fraction. She freezes again. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You were in the car! "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I wasn't. I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio. He said someone was... "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Don't give me that! I was on the bridge. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What happened to Jim? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) There was nobody on the bridge. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What happened to Jim? "
"(N) Ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Dead. Dead. Dead! Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead, they're dead. They're all dead! "
"(N) ETHAN releases her wrists. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) (M) (mumbling) They're dead. Jim's dead. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Take off your coat. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Take off your God damn coat! "
"(N) He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- spinning her around. The coat hits the floor like a dead body. CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. "
"(N) CLAIRE begins to shiver. ETHAN circles her, runs his hand cursorily across her body. It accentuates CLAIRE'S shivering. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) Where were you? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) (M) (slowly) Who is ""they?"" "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Did they send you...Did they send you? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Who is they, who is they? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Who sent you?! Who sent you? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) (M) (screaming) No one sent me! We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --! "
"(N) She sags. A moment. Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG. In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN releases his grip on her wrists. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, still waiting for a response. CLAIRE sitting on the end of the bed. Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Why haven't they brought us in yet? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. "
"(N) A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What are you going to do? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. CLAIRE Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. "
"(N) The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. "
"(M) THE COMPUTER SCREEN"
"(M) ? BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL "
"(M) ? AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS "
"(M) ? STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH"
"(N) CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) The message is for Job. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'm going to answer it. "
"(S) EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to ETHAN. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match? "
"(N) Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. "
"(S) INT. CAR - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood. He extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Would you remove your hat please? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why? "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission. "
"(S) INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY"
"(N) The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting upright. He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn. The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. "
"(N) Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is VACUUMING. MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I thought I was going to see Max. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) You misunderstood. No one sees Max. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Then what am I doing here? "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I don't communicate very well through a shroud. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'm willing to take the chance. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Very well. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Who are you and what are you doing here? ETHAN I need one hundred thousand dollars. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a paradox. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) That depends. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) On what? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) It's quite out of the question. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) And how might you know that? Are you another Company man? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Like Job? "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Ah, but, we're asking about you. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'm NOC. Was. Now disavowed. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Why, may I ask? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) That's the question I want to ask Job. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I don't know Job any more than he knows me. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Why should I? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) (M) (Pause.) Mm - Hmmm... "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Very good. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up first. "
"(M) ANGLE"
"(N) MATTHIAS boots up. There's a little musical noise and the screen brightens. The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information scrolls by. But Matthias is watching the digital read-out on the RF scanner. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Twenty-six, twenty-seven. So far so good. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) That's not so good for you, my friend. "
"(N) On the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Thirty-two and change. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) (M) (to Ethan) Doesn't mean it's a signal. Could just be the hard drive heating up. "
"(N) She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to make up her mind about something. "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Forty-four. Forty-five. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'd say you've got about two minutes. "
"(N) MAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows -- "
"(S) EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY"
"(N) Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street sign. WOOF. WOOF. WOOF. Abruptly, it stops. "
"(S) INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY "
"(N) Back inside: "
"(C) MATTHIAS"
"(D) Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. "
"(S) EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT"
"(N) A pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the van. "
"(S) INT. MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY"
"(N) Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit the stairs. They climb them silently. "
"(S) INT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY"
"(C) FEMALE IMF"
"(D) (M) (in czech) Switch it on. Keep cleaning. "

"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) GOD D- "
"(S) INT. MAX'S CAR - ETHAN AND MAX - DAY "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again. (M) (turns to Ethan) Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. You're a good sport. Do accept the compliment. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine? "
"(S) INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket. (M) (abruptly) My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What was your deal with Job? "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Six million dollars. I'll give you the same. But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe. I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous. I want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Ten million. Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) How will you make sure Job will be there? "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days? It's been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money. "
"(N) MAX manages to laugh without coughing. Then, with an admonishing forefinger: "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I'm going to have to front you personally. Don't lose that money without losing your life. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I wouldn't dream of it. "
"(N) MAX settles back and regards ETHAN. A theatrical sigh. She fancies this guy. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY"
"(N) KITTRIDGE waits on the balcony for his AGENTS to complete their search. HARRY BARNES, a middle-aged, gray suited, somewhat gray-faced bureaucrat, comes to join Kittridge. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) The man's gone black, Barnes. He's under until he decides to surface. "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to be ghosts. We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake! "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) So what do you suggest? "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Let's not waste time chasing him. Make him come to us. EverybodyÃ­s got pressure points. Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN enters the living room. CLAIRE walks out of the bedroom holding a gun. "
"(N) ETHAN reaches into his jacket and holds up a hefty wad of currency. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Max made a deal with you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You're sure about this? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. (M) ( ALT ) I want to get the son of a bitch who did this. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What kind of help? "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN plugs the phone cable from his laptop into the back. The green display on top of the KY57 dials a number and makes a computer connection. "
"(N) On the computer, the screen says: "
"(M) I.M.F. PERSONNEL DATABASE ENTER PASSWORD NOW"
"(N) ETHAN types a password and the screen asks him for the "
"(M) CATEGORY?"
"(N) He types in a single word. "
"(M) DISAVOWED"
"(M) DISSOLVE TO:"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Simple game. Four players. (M) (points to Krieger) Exfil opens the pocket -- (M) (and to Luther) -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Bank? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) IMF mainframe. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) (M) (after a moment) Where exactly is it? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) In Langley. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) In Langley? The one in Virginia, Langley? "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Inside CIA headquarters at Langley. "
"(N) ETHAN nods. KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE. "
"(C) KRIEGER (CONT'D)"
"(D) Is he serious? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Always. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) What are we downloading? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Information. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) What kind? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Profitable. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Payment on delivery. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) I don't know. This I don't know. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of. What'd they used to call you? The Net Ranger? Phineas Phreak? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. (M) (correcting himself) With that exceptional piece of work. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto. Cray access. STU 3's -- "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Krieger can get it. (M) (to Krieger) Right? "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) May take a little time. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence Risk chip -- "
"(N) ETHAN looks at KRIEGER. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Twenty-four hours. "
"(N) ETHAN looks back at LUTHER. LUTHER thinks. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) And I get to keep the equipment when we're done. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses."
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down. "
"(S) INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY"
"(C) ETHAN (V.O.)"
"(D) They missed nothing in that room. Even the vents have laser nets over them. "
"(N) Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into a ""RESTRICTED"" area of the building. "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY"
"(C) ETHAN (V.O.)"
"(D) Inside, there are three countermeasure systems that can only be deactivated by authorized entry. Which we won't have. "
"(N) A panel next to the ANALYST says ""INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES OFF."" The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, CHUNKS the door open and steps into -- "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY"
"(C) ETHAN (V.O.)"
"(D) The first system is sound-sensitive, anything above a whisper sets it off. The second system is on the floor and pressure-sensitive --"
"(C) ETHAN (V.O.)"
"(D) --and the third detects any increase in temperature. Even the body heat of an unauthorized person in the room will trigger it. "
"(N) A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 degrees. The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. "
"(C) ETHAN (V.O.)"
"(D) All three systems are state of the art. The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea. A drop of condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it makes contact, the floor panel lights up. "
"(S) INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) The other team members gathered around the table look at ETHAN skeptically. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) And you really think we can do this. "
"(S) INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT "
"(N) The middle of the night and the train is dark. The team members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER heads in one direction, ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other."
"(N) ETHAN stops. His attention is drawn to the car ahead. There is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it. "
"(M) ETHAN'S P.O.V. THRU WINDOW (INT. BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)"
"(N) Ethan sees the business car, a plush space for busy executives to get some work done on the train. There are laptops, cellular phones, desks that fold out in front of spacious seats. "
"(S) INT. TRAIN - CORRIDOR - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN knocks on the compartment door. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) May I come in? "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) (M) (wary but interested) Sure... "
"(N) ETHAN and CLAIRE enter, ETHAN closing the compartment door. He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her. She takes it, waits. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) You don't think we're going to make it. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I didn't say that. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) You didn't have to......... "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I just need you to be safe. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What about you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe. "
"(N) CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to take it in. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. "
"(N) And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing and half-falling onto the converted bed. She suddenly resists. He senses it and pulls away. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Sorry. "
"(N) He rises and goes to the door. He's got his hand on the knob when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him to her and kisses him, deeply. This time they sink slowly to the bed. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. CIA LANGLEY - DAY "
"(N) Seen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex, two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked out of a thick forest. "
"(S) INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the disavowed file, even after we cut off his authorization code. "
"(C) AGENT LOWDEN/AGENT"
"(D) MAREK He may have used Phelps' code. They were friends, and Phelps, was still valid for twenty-four hours. "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) If that's the case, we need to implement a system to immediately deactivate an agent's code immediately... "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) I can't believe what I'm listening to. Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys are standing here trying to figure out what kind of shoes he had on! I don't care how he did it, I want to know why he did it! Is he recruiting? For what purpose? "
"(N) From somewhere in the building, an ALARM sounds, not too loud in here. "
"(C) AGENT PAT/AGENT"
"(D) LOWDEN Survival. "
"(N) The alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the building. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Too short sighted. This guy's proactive, he initiates. The question is what does he want now and where does he need to get it and Barnes what the hell is that noise?! "
"(C) AGENT"
"(D) Fire alarm, Gene. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Oh, for -- do we have to evacuate? "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) That's S.O.P.. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) S.O.P.. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. VIRGINIA TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY"
"(S) INT. CIA LANGLEY LOBBY - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk. He looks up, above him. "
"(N) Etched into the top of one wall are the words ""AND YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE."""
"(N) They reach the GUARD. ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows to the front of the group and takes charge. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (to the Guard) We picked up alarms in sectors three, seven, and twelve. "
"(C) GUARD RICHARD"
"(D) Yeah. That's what I've got too. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (to the Guard) What sector's the air conditioning? "
"(C) GUARD RANDALL"
"(D) Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I gotta go in there and shut it down! "
"(C) GUARD RANDALL"
"(D) Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building? "
"(C) GUARD RICHARD"
"(D) (M) (reciting policy) Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did not go off --"
"(S) EXT. CIA LANGLEY - PARKING AREA - DAY "
"(N) One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the parking area of the headquarters building. Second truck roars past. LUTHER watches it go. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company manuals with names like ""COSMOS"" and ""SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICE."" "
"(N) One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn GUARD, who's finishing his sentence. GUARD (on screen) --and it did not go off in twenty-one! "
"(N) LUTHER turns to a screen on another computer and searches through a complex facilities menu. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) (M) (mouths) Twenty-one, twenty-one --"
"(N) He finds what he's looking for and double clicks on it. A red box on his screen lights up -- "
"(S) INT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY "
"(C) GUARD RANDALL"
"(D) Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Let's move! "
"(N) ETHAN turns and looks at one of the FIREMEN behind them -- it's CLAIRE. CLAIRE and KRIEGER follow ETHAN/GUARD to corridor. "
"(S) INT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY "
"(N) CLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing a business suit underneath. She clips an ID tag to her breast pocket. "
"(N) She pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer printout of a man's ID photo. She stares at the face, studying it. "
"(S) INT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY "
"(N) She sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper. It's the man whose picture she looked at in the storage room. She sits next to him. "
"(N) He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then goes back to his paper. "
"(N) He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a perfume sampler. She dumps the clear liquid contents into his coffee. He turns back and hands her part of the paper. CLAIRE smiles. "
"(N) She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. "
"(N) He smiles. But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of shiny gray metallic tape. CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE MAN drinks up and leaves the table. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a blueprint of the inside of the building. A cursor begins to flash in one of the rooms. LUTHER smiles. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Hi there. "
"(S) INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Air conditioning's through here! "
"(N) They turn a corner, walking directly past -- "
"(C) CIA ANALYST"
"(D) William Donloe. "
"(S) INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing. ETHAN putting the mask in a bag. "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Where's the other guy? "
"(N) ETHAN turns. Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with the other. He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Zero body count. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) (M) (a threat) We'll see. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Time up. "
"(N) ETHAN releases him and walks away. "
"(S) INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY "
"(N) The first climb is straight up. KRIEGER cups his hands under ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to climb. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving horizontally now. They reach a juncture and turn right. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast. Luther, I'm going in. Don't disappoint me...Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct. A laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- crossing every which way. ETHAN looks down, through the net. "
"(N) He can see the computer room below and the top of the TECHNICIAN'S head. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of his hands. KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- sided, pyramid shaped glass object. "
"(N) ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what it is -- a prism. "
"(N) The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the shaft. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing. When it appears ready to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. "
"(N) The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. "
"(N) The screw is pulled up, through the shaft. Now the whole shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. "
"(N) It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. "
"(N) A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees. A gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the tube, cooling the room. "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY"
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY"
"(N) It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw earlier. No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. "
"(N) At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his ankles and understand. "
"(N) He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer. Suddenly ETHAN is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the ANALYST enters the room. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead -- "
"(C) TECHNICIAN"
"(D) Oh, God. "
"(N) He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again. Puzzled, sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY "
"(N) Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the alarm systems with a card-key. They HUM back to life efficiently, a light flashing: "
"(M) INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON"
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in front of the computer. "
"(N) A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the set of pulleys. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out on his forehead. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) He blinks, unable to believe this. He curls himself into a situp and looks up, into the shaft. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) KRIEGER sees the predicament. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor. Slowly, KRIEGER drops him another few feet. Now ETHAN's lower than the terminal and still three feet away from it. He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what ETHAN sees. "
"(N) He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and begins to whisper. We hear only the moist, airy sound of his breath, not the words. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Type this password: AW96B6. Return. Go to the files menu, find the NOC list file. Open ""NOC List."" Put your diskette in. Double click on the NOC list. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly. He reaches out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it and starts typing, softly. "
"(N) The computer HUMS, activated. ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy drive. "
"(N) The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR. ETHAN winces, even that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances. "
"(N) But no alarms go off. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) LUTHER cranes his head again to see the computer terminal through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint. He WHISPERS more commands."
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Ok, good! It's scrolling. 0K, now we're going to download. Edit menu. Select ""copy to disc"". You're downloading. When it's all green it's done. "

"(N) KRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope. His eyes suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. "
"(N) It's a rat. KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back. Neither moves. Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls forward, inquisitive. "

"(S) INT. CIA - MEN'S - DAY "

"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Merci. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We're not outta here yet. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY "

"(S) INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY "
"(N) In the communications room, tempers are running a little high. KITTRIDGE is on his feet, berating his staff. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Think, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face! What does Ethan Hunt want?! "

"(D) Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list! "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Okay! "
"(N) Now it's coming together in KITTRIDGE'S mind and a horrible thought occurs to him. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) And where is the list vulnerable? "
"(N) There is nervous silence for a moment. Behind KITTRIDGE, on the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) (M) (joking) Other than here. "
"(N) Nervous laughter goes around the table. It fades. On the other side of the room, the AGENT who answered the phone turns, receiver in hand, face ashen. "

"(C) BARNES"

"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. LONDON - NIGHT "
"(S) INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT "
"(N) This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in. ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max. He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk. "
"(N) CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. "
"(N) KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) You contacting your buyer? (M) (no answer) Ethan? "
"(N) From the desk, ETHAN glances up. Then goes back to the computer. KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. "
"(C) KRIEGER (CONT'D)"
"(D) Ethan? Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? "
"(N) ETHAN ignores him, working. His computer jams with static as it connects to a BBS. The screen blinks and displays the familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted Max. When it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next code. He begins to type. "
"(N) KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of Ethan's hands to the floor. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) You're not going to any meeting without me. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) My contact is extremely shy. "
"(N) He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the ""ENTER"" button. "
"(N) LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN sighs and stands up. KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Krieger. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Don't you mean this? "
"(N) He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical disk. He puts it back in his jacket pocket. "
"(N) KRIEGER stares for a second. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) That's not it. That's not the list. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What's the matter, you don't know this trick? "
"(N) He holds the jacket pocket wide open, for KRIEGER to look into. KRIEGER does. The pocket is empty. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) (M) (mock surprise) Where did it go?! It's GONE! "
"(N) ETHAN walks over to CLAIRE, reaches into the pocket of the trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) But not too far! "
"(N) He palms the disk in his right hand. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) I know what you're thinking, Krieger. You're thinking, back in the computer room -- I was up here -- he was down there -- . He was carrying two discs. "
"(N) While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from KRIEGER. When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again. He holds up his left hand. It's there now. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) So hard to keep track of these things. "
"(N) ETHAN shows his hands -- now both are empty. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) (M) (fuming) Where is it? "
"(N) ETHAN pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I thought you had it! Do you actually think I'd let you have the NOC list? "
"(N) KRIEGER just stares at him, shaken. CLAIRE laughs. KRIEGER looks at her. He turns completely red. When he looks back at ETHAN, ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and IÃ­ll cut your throat. "
"(N) He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms out, SLAMMING the door behind him. ETHAN picks up the Bible and sees Drake Hotel. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I've never worked with him. I'm sorry, Ethan. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We did what we had to do. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I'm going to try and get some sleep. "
"(N) She leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving ETHAN and LUTHER alone. "
"(M) ANGLE "
"(N) ETHAN waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off carefully. "
"(N) He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his jacket pocket. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Krieger did have the NOC list. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Now I want you to hold onto it. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) What makes you trust me? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) I'm not letting this list get out in the open. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing? "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I'll get you close. "
"(N) Claire opens the door. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Ethan I need to talk to you. "

"(M) BACK TO SCENE "
"(M) ETHAN "
"(M) INSERT - SCREEN "
"(C) VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world. Some thirty-four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently widowed Mrs. Hunt and her brother-in-law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution network. "
"(N) A public official exits the building. The reporter and other news crews charge up to him. "
"(C) REPORTER"
"(D) Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment please. "
"(N) The image on the television changes to an interview with a PUBLIC OFFICIAL who faces a bank of microphones. "
"(C) PUBLIC OFFICIAL"
"(D) I think it's sad, really. Farmers, unless they're a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper-thin margin. I'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means. "
"(C) REPORTER"
"(D) That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in charge of this investigation. Officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the Hunts. This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, Wisconsin. "
"(M) BACK TO SCENE "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Kittridge... "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Bastard! "
"(N) ETHAN switches TV off and paces away from it. His anger erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the wall. CLAIRE tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her away. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Don't...don't touch me... "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What are you going to do? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (turns to her and gestures at TV) He's expecting my call. (M) (strides to door) I'm going to the station... (M) (o/s at door) And I'm going to call him. "

"(N) KITTRIDGE nods. "

"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) (M) (covering receiver) Get MI5. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Ethan, I want to reassure you that my first order of business after you come in is to get these ridiculous charges against your family dropped and eliminated completely from their files. Come in now, we can plea down the charges against you as well. "
"(N) The wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down. The TECHNICIAN is frantically signalling KITTRIDGE to keep talking. KITTRIDGE is momentarily stuck. Fortunately: "
"(C) ETHAN (O.S.)"
"(D) Can I ask you something, Kittridge? KITTRIDGE Certainly Ethan. "
"(S) INT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse? "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) Lost him. We needed three more seconds. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) He wanted us to know he was in London. "
"(N) Clearly that's the question that KITTRIDGE is turning over in his mind and he doesn't have a simple answer to it. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT "
"(N) The man is JIM PHELPS. "

"(M) INT - RAILWAY STATION CAFE (DAY) "
"(N) ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth, PHELPS looking clammy and listing to one side. But the banter seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, finishing each other's sentences: "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) - and picked us up in the States -"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places.. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records - "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street. "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Hey, I showed 'em to you! "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I remember.. "
"(N) PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an upright position. He opens a medicine bottle and takes the pain killers. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight. "
"(C) PHELPS"

"(N) On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them into the Vltava River. "
"(C) ETHAN VO"
"(D) - he must have had back up take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.. "
"(N) There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence.. "
"(C) ETHAN VO"
"(D) How did he do Hannah? "
"(N) Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion brilliant behind her... "

"(N) ETHAN looking intently at him."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why, Jim? Why?"
"(N) Awkward moment."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission. The son-of-a- bitch! How dare he? You realize itÃ­s over, youÃ­re an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youÃ­ve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.

"(D) Tight security. No guns. Real plus."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. IÃ­ll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris."
"(N) PHELPS looks away. Seems badly shaken."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jim...?"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking IÃ­m dead and gone. God knows what sheÃ­s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.."
"(N) PHELPS breaks off abruptly. Apparently some inner struggle over this threatens to overwhelm him. Then, controlling it:"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) - no. She canÃ­t know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. ThereÃ­s too much at stake, Ethan."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) YouÃ­re probably right."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) I usually am."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. IÃ­ll call you from Paris."

"(D) You got it."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) And get a doctor."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Good luck."
"(N) The door to CLAIRE'S room in the safe house opens, throwing a shaft of light over her form. ETHAN creeps in and closes the door behind him."
"(N) It is approximately one a.m. . CLAIRE is huddled in the corner. ETHAN enters and stands looking at her."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) What happened?"
"(C) ETHAN"

"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Yes.......come here....viens pres moi..."
"(N) She draws him down by his hand to kiss her."
"(N) He kisses her again, more fully. She wraps an arm around him and he holds onto the kiss. The room appears to revolve around them."
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. PRIVATE HELIPAD - DAY"
"(N) Suddenly itÃ­s bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our eyes."
"(N) KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking at the sunlight and hurry down the steps."
"(N) KITTRIDGE looks at him. He rips it open. A note inside simply says:"
"(N) KITTRIDGE looks at his watch. ItÃ­s ten to twelve."
"(N) As he reads the note, something else falls out of the envelope and CLUNKS to the ground."
"(N) He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it. Cradled in his hand, we canÃ­t see what it is. But to him, itÃ­s very interesting."

"(N) MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer disk as promised. She hands it to Matthias who strips off the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the computer in the briefcase. He boots it up quickly and turns the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to see."
"(N) One half of the screen, with the heading ""CRYPTONYM AND OPERATIONAL SPECS"" is already jammed with information. The blank second half of the screen acquires the title ""TRUE NAME,"" and information starts filling itself in rapidly -- names, addresses, identities."
"(N) As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:"
"(M) IDENTITY MATCH"

"(D) The possibility alone is worth ten million. Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314."
"(C) ETHAN (O.S.)"
"(D) What about Job?"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I wouldnÃ­t worry about him. Once youÃ­ve got the money -- heÃ­ll find you."

"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) HeÃ­s putting on a show, Barnes."
"(C) BARNES"

"(N) KITTRIDGE and BARNES go off back through the next coach. CLAIRE follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into her wristwatch to ETHAN:"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Ethan...Kittridge is on the train."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther?"
"(C) CLAIRE"

"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) This is bullshit - we donÃ­t even know what Max looks like."
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) Maybe we donÃ­t have to know what he looks like. If heÃ­s got that list, heÃ­s going to want to check it. We should be looking for laptops."
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Good idea."
"(S) INT. BUSINESS CAR - (LUTHER) - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER sees them coming. He smacks the laptop shut and positions his jamming phone on the table to point at MaxÃ­s computer. He gets up, taking his computer with him, headed for the rear of the car. A WAITER sees the phone and goes after LUTHER with it."
"(C) WAITER"

"(M) TRANSFER IN PROGRESS"

"(D) ItÃ­s working."
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Phew! WeÃ­ve got five minutes..."
"(S) INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER shuts himself in the bathroom. The OTHER MAN follows him, tries the door and waits his moment. The OTHER MAN bangs against the door. LUTHER braces himself against the door."
"(S) INT. ANOTHER CAR - MOVING - DAY"

"(D) Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being modemed off the train."
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Where?"
"(S) INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) CLAIRE enters a little breathless. Spotting PHELPÃ­S profile in the darkened car."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) EthanÃ­s right behind me. Listen to me Jim. Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money. Ethan takes the blame. No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Of course - IÃ­m sorry to hear you say that Claire."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Ethan?"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Yes. Ethan Hunt, darling. Remember him?"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) You knew about Jim?"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Before London. But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) They stamped it, didnÃ­t they? Those damn Gideons."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Two minutes til Krieger shows. ThisÃ­ll have to be quicker than IÃ­d like. Certainly quicker than youÃ­d like."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youÃ­ve asked the question and you are the answer."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I knew about Jim."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) But, he didnÃ­t know about you. In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. ""Thou shall not covet thy NeighbourÃ­s wife"", Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the worldÃ­s lovers, heÃ­s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - ""does she feel the same way I do?"""
"(N) JIM turns to CLAIRE."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?"

"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Keep counting Claire."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) It was me. I did it."
"(N) CLAIRE hands PHELPS the money."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Satisfied?"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) All ten million."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Fold it. Fold it tight."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) ArenÃ­t you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) DonÃ­t flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) YouÃ­re wrong about one thing. IÃ­m not the only one whoÃ­s seen you alive."

"(D) You son of a bitch."
"(N) PHELPS points the gun at ETHAN."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) DonÃ­t Jim."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Now we donÃ­t have to eliminate him? You like that, donÃ­t you Claire? DonÃ­t you?"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Yes."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jim, itÃ­s over."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Ethan - IÃ­ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you."
"(N) PHELPS shoots CLAIRE. Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN. The gun is lost. PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground. His watch alarm beeps rapidly. He turns, goes up the stairs and..."
"(N) ETHAN goes to CLAIRE. ETHAN Claire...Hey..."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) This stuff is so sticky."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Claire."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) ItÃ­s all right, Ethan..youÃ­ll bring me back...wonÃ­t you..."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I always have, Claire.. "
"(N) CLAIRE dies. ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder. "
"(S) INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door and climbs through it -- "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the smooth surface of the train. "
"(N) Now for the tough part. Using the suction cups, PHELPS slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes. "
"(N) He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the ENGINEER. "
"(N) Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his belt."
"(N) He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train. From out of the fog, a helicopter approaches. "
"(N) PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going. In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the English Channel. His eyes widen. "
"(S) INT. HELICOPTER - DAY"
"(N) KRIEGER is at the controls. He sees the approaching tunnel as well. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position. Looking up, he sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. "
"(N) ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. "
"(N) A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. "
"(N) He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way. Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. "
"(S) INT. HELICOPTER - DAY"
"(N) KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching. He gestures to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over PHELPS and then back to him. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the roof. "
"(N) ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto the roof. "
"(N) PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance. "
"(N) They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. "
"(S) INT. HELICOPTER - DAY"
"(N) KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now. He paws at the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the train. PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on. "
"(M) -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! "
"(S) INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes one last time. This time it says: "
"(M) CONNECTION TERMINATED. TRANSFER LOST."
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Damn!"
"(S) INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY"
"(C) CONDUCTOR"
"(D) No, no, it's IN the tunnel! "
"(C) VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Stop the train! "
"(C) CONDUCTOR"
"(D) It'll crash into us! Accelerate, accelerate. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY"
"(N) For a moment, we see no one. No ETHAN. No PHELPS. Moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone. "
"(N) They're dangling from either side of it. "
"(N) PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train. ETHAN reaches for the other cup. "
"(N) The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER pushing it up to full speed again. "
"(N) But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY"
"(N) He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction. "
"(N) Another train. "
"(N) At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by. "
"(N) The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS misses the skid. "
"(N) KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ETHAN with the rotor. PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel. SPARKS and chunks of cement fly. "
"(N) KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly. ETHAN uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. "
"(N) PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls out -- "
"(N) PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles frantically for his gun. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Red light, green light. Asta Lasagna mother fucker. "
"(N) ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the copter's underbelly and turns away from it. "
"(N) PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- "
"(N) The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. "
"(N) ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly drained. "
"(S) INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by BARNES. LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) I think this is what you're looking for. "
"(N) MAX looks up, stunned. KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to wait for her to speak. "
"(N) When she finally does, she's almost charming. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) My lawyers will have a field day with this. Entrapment, jurisdictional conflicts -- "
"(N) KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as friendly. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of this one. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I'm sure we can find something I have that you need. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) You know, I would love to try. "
"(S) EXT. LONDON PUB - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while he sips a beer. A television screen is featuring follow-up coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in the chunnel. Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was there were no other fatalaties. There are intermittent sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of arrivals and departures. ETHAN into shot. He sits beside LUTHER. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Reach your folks? (M) (ETHAN nods) How they feeling? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) About what? "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys. "
"(N) LUTHER picks up his beer. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) (M) (Laughs and with a British accent) Cheers. "
"(N) They drink. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Here's to you, Luther. (M) (clink glasses) To being off the disavowed list. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Sure. They want me back in so I won't break in! They still can't figure out how we did it. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe, talk about it. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (laughing) It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Why don't you come back with me? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Just don't know why I'd be doing it. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) You really liked Phelps, didn't you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. (M) (looks up) Gotta catch my flight..(M) (rising) So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again? "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way. "
"(N) The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no more. The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative LUTHER looking after him. "
"(S) INT. PLANE - NIGHT "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Would you like to watch a movie, Miss Clarke? "
"(N) She then stops before ETHAN. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Excuse me, Mr. Hunt. Would you like to watch a movie."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) No, thank you."
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean? "
"(N) ETHAN just stares at her. This couldn't be what it's sounding like. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Aruba, perhaps? "
"(N) The camera moves into ETHAN's face. They found him. They want him back. He looks up at her and..... "
"(M) CUT TO BLACK "
"(M) THE END "
