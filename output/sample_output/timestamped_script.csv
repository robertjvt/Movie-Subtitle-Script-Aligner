"(M) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT"
"(M) 16TH AUGUST 1995"
"(M) NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME ""SCENE OMITTED"" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY."
"(S) INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT"
"(N) We're in a large closet. JACK KIEFER, an athletic American in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen."
"(N) The television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet. The TV image is in black and white. JACK shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while"
"(M) ON THE SCREEN"
"(N) A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room. Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T- shirt. There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the room behind him. A legend:"
"(N) KASIMOV is sobbing. Uncontrollably. A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather. The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out. ANATOLY looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him. KASIMOV does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY. They speak in Russian which is subtitled."
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us."
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) (M) (sobbing) I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun."
"(N) ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room. A WOMAN lies half under the sheets. She's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood. She's dead. ANATOLY lifts her eyelid."
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her! I didn't lay a finger on her."
"(N) ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN."
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Kasimov. Don't flounder."
"(M) IN THE CLOSET"
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Jesus, she's been under too long. Come on, come on! (T) 00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:55,099"
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) You're the only one who can help me. "
"(N) Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket. But ANATOLY hits his hand away and smacks him around the head. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) JACK reacts. "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN"
"(N) ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) They'll kill me. "
"(N) ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) You asked for my help. You asked for my help...come on... "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) You're right, of course. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) JACK leans forward. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) The name pal...give us the name. "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) The contact in Minsk..the contact in Minsk..works in a travel agency. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Come on! (T) 00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,170(T) 00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,279"
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Come on! "
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Got him. "
"(M) ON THE SCREEN "
"(N) Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder as if he had just anointed him. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross checks -- ""MIEDIEV"" comes up, then ""posting/American consulate/Kiev."" "
"(N) JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic and virtually no bottom. She quickly leaves. "
"(S) INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot glasses. "
"(C) ANATOLY"
"(D) Now, we drink. "
"(N) He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. "
"(C) ANATOLY (CONT'D)"
"(D) To friends. (T) 00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,659(T) 00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,691"
"(C) KASIMOV"
"(D) Yes, Anatoly, yes. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Cheers. "
"(N) He drinks. He blinks. Something felt funny about that. Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY moves to the closet door and opens it. "
"(M) IN THE CLOSET "
"(N) ANATOLY reaches up to his face --"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) (M) (in English now) Get rid of this scum. (T) 00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,015"
"(N) ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the dead woman's thigh. He checks her pulse again, checking a stopwatch. In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. "
"(N) CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her mouth. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Did we get it? (T) 00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,889"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We got it. On your feet. (T) 00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:00,975"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I want to sleep. Can I sleep here. (T) 00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:29,341"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Walk, just walk. Start walking. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I'm walking. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Talking's good, walking's better. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Sleeping's better. "
"(N) JACK comes into the room from the closet. He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring. ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing. She looks up at him questioningly. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you? "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Oh yeah? "
"(N) JACK comes into the room from the closet. He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring. ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing. She looks up at him, questioningly. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Claire. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Jack. "
"(N) She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger. ETHAN notices. He turns and SHOUTS to the room at large. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Just waiting for you, tubs. "
"(N) He walks across the room and out the door. CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring. "
"(N) We move in on it --"
"(M) CUT TO: "
"(S) INT. JET - DAY"
"(N) The pilot's voice makes an announcement. "
"(C) VOICE (O.S.)"
"(D) Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be arriving in Prague right on schedule. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? (T) 00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,699"
"(N) A passenger takes one. The ATTENDANT continues on. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) (M) (CONT'D) Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps? (T) 00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,626"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) No, I prefer the theatre. (T) 00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,284(T) 00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,669"
"(N) A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes stilted. "
"(C) FLIGHT ATTENDANT"
"(D) Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine? (T) 00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,464(T) 00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,619"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Perhaps you'd choose one for me. (T) 00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,426(T) 00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:23,265(T) 00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,631"
"(M) AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN."
"(M) BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT"
"(N) PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the armrest, and puts the tape in. "
"(N) He presses play."
"(M) ON THE TAPE, "
"(N) the image of a man comes on. EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than tieless. But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever look away. He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) (M) (on the tape) Good morning, Mr. Phelps. The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- (T) 00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,209(T) 00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:53,128"
"(N) The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man in his forties. The image is herky-jerky videotape, presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks down a foreign street. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) -- a former KGB Line X officer now working the international black market selling intelligence. This morning, we learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe. (T) 00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,262(T) 00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:05,391"
"(N) The screen shows an image of what such a list might look like, code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) For security reasons, the NOC list is divided into two encoded halves. Golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas. This portion is useless unless combined with the second half -- the true name list that is kept in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. (T) 00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,311(T) 00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,691(T) 00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,404(T) 00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,984"
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list. I don't have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim. We're keeping it internally black. Because of its urgency, I've already sent to Prague a team selected from your usual group. (T) 00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:23,117(T) 00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,247(T) 00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:31,375(T) 00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,884"
"(N) Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) Ethan Hunt will of course be your point man, as usual. He's in Kiev; we're getting word to him now. (T) 00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,508(T) 00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:53,856"
"(S) INT. JET - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his tired brow. KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (O.S.)"
"(D) As always, should you or any member of your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. This tape will self- destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim! (T) 00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:15,860(T) 00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:02,156(T) 00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,200(T) 00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:07,745(T) 00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,873(T) 00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,500"
"(N) PHELPS inhales deeply -- "
"(M) CUT TO: "
"(S) EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY"
"(N) SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. Another legend: "
"(M) PRAGUE "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. Can you hear me?(T) 00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,421(T) 00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,261(T) 00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,389(T) 00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,191(T) 00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,444(T) 00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:50,996(T) 00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,290(T) 00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,464(T) 00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,511(T) 00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,981(T) 00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:25,531"
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Of course I can hear you. (T) 00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,986(T) 00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,530(T) 00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,535"
"(C) JACK"
"(D) No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile (M) (eyes). Can you hear me now? (T) 00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,766(T) 00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,519(T) 00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,617(T) 00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,002(T) 00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:11,267(T) 00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,234"
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Loud and clear. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) What's going on? (T) 00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,633"
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) I don't know. (T) 00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,698(T) 00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,356"
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Why don't you take a look? (T) 00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:41,630"
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Jack...that's spying. (T) 00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,694"
"(C) JACK"
"(D) That's what we do isn't it? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) Jack you're so wicked. "
"(C) JACK"
"(D) Too wicked to have a drink later? "
"(C) SARAH"
"(D) I think I might just take that look. (T) 00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,069"
"(N) ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming. (T) 00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,878(T) 00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:54,935(T) 00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,822"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one. (T) 00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,687(T) 00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,662(T) 00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,215(T) 00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,676(T) 00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,734(T) 00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,451"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I thought I'd take some now. (T) 00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,181"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) (M) (quietly, to Ethan) What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Oh? What's the problem? (T) 00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,459"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me. (T) 00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,137(T) 00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,813(T) 00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,532(T) 00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,429"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Tell you what? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev? (T) 00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,125(T) 00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,038(T) 00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,665"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What problem? (T) 00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,547"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) (M) (laughs) Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?(T) 00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,300"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I guess. (T) 00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,867(T) 00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,266(T) 00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,975"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Ethan, you can't burn out. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why not? "
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) How was Chicago? (T) 00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,920"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says ""All right. Who was it? My friend Harry?"" She says no. ""Oh, it was my friend Sammy."" She says it wasn't Sammy. ""Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."" ""No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"" (T) 00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,843(T) 00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,389"
"(N) PHELPS laughs. ETHAN doesn't. The back of CLAIRE'S head is in his line of sight. "
"(C) PHELPS (CONT'D)"
"(D) Boy, you really are grim. Come here, take a look. "
"(N) He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. "
"(S) EXT. PRAGUE - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN's POV of Embassy. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN nods. "
"(C) PHELPS (CONT'D)"
"(D) Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy. See it? Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe. Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them. If they're exposed, they'll be executed. Come over here. Take a lock at this. (T) 00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,103(T) 00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:40,189(T) 00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,901(T) 00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:47,154(T) 00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:51,575(T) 00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:07,424(T) 00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:19,770"
"(N) ETHAN is distracted by it. "
"(M) INSERT - TELEVISION"
"(C) SENATOR WALTZER"
"(D) I'll go you one further. I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst. It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's ""black budget."" These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one -- who are these people?! We were living in a democracy the last time I checked. (T) 00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,705(T) 00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,169(T) 00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,589(T) 00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:22,064(T) 00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,400(T) 00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,222(T) 00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:57,725"

"(N) ETHAN looks back at JIM. "
"(C) ETHAN"

"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) He's our guy. (T) 00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:32,241(T) 00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:37,830"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? (T) 00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,041"
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. (T) 00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,462(T) 00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:47,840(T) 00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,384"

"(C) PHELPS"

"(N) ETHAN closes his eyes. KITTRIDGEÃ­S voice is strong and reassuring and he needs that right now."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I donÃ­t think so.(T) 00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:55,724(T) 00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:30,676"

"(S) EXT. STREET - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street. Every face seems to be starring at him now, every sound is menacing. He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd."
"(S) EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering, gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by residential buildings."
"(N) Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace."
"(N) Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza."
"(S) INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT"
"(M) ETHAN'S POV "
"(N) ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are scattered around. "

"(C) KITTRIDGE"

"(N) KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, carefully: KITTRIDGE You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Who else is left? (T) 00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,092"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Yes. I see your point. (T) 00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:51,298(T) 00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:01,684(T) 00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,805"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why was there another team? (T) 00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:46,770"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) What? (T) 00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:49,064"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight. (T) 00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,485"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) I don't quite follow you. (T) 00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:56,864"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Let's see if you can follow me around this room. (M) (eyes moving around the room) The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why?(T) 00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:15,948(T) 00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:02,912(T) 00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,665(T) 00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:13,005(T) 00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,883(T) 00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,510(T) 00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:19,803(T) 00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,766"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) (M) (a tight little smile) You're right. Maybe this'll save some time. "
"(N) The figures around the room have grown restless. KITTRIDGE tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out of his jacket. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as ""Max.""(T) 00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,479(T) 00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:32,358(T) 00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,026(T) 00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,363(T) 00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:39,740"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) The arms dealer. (T) 00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:42,368"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as ""Job 314"". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. (T) 00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:46,705(T) 00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:51,001(T) 00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:54,421(T) 00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:58,717(T) 00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,345(T) 00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,056"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. (T) 00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:09,186"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. ""Golitsyn"" was a lightning rod, one of ours. (T) 00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:14,233(T) 00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,485"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) This whole operation was a molehunt. (T) 00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:23,576(T) 00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,750"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived. (T) 00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,419(T) 00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,257(T) 00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:42,303(T) 00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:47,641"
"(N) ETHAN stares at him levelly. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) I want to show you something, Ethan. (T) 00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:52,521"
"(N) He now shoves the papers across the table. They're xeroxed copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and MARGARET ETHAN HUNT. It shows a balance of $127, 000. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...

"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) Ethan, I can understand you're very upset. (T) 00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,431"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset. (T) 00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:30,100"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) All right, enough is enough Hunt. You've bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it. You're determined to shake hands with the devil and I'm going to make sure you do it in hell. (T) 00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:32,937(T) 00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,231(T) 00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,610(T) 00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:41,695"
"(N) We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, mushing the two sides together. "
"(N) ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the table in one quick motion. As he does, he hurls the piece of gum. "
"(N) Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass. KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- "
"(N) The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish tank. A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. "
"(N) At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. "
"(S) EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the deserted square. "
"(S) EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT"

"(N) ETHAN unscrews a bulb. He crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps. He climbs to the next bulb. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT"
"(N) At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT "
"(N) In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking them as he goes. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can. He unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports. "
"(N) As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a mess. He splashes water on his face. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT"
"(N) ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. "
"(S) INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT"
"(N) He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching. One by one, he switches them off. "
"(M) THE LAPTOP "
"(N) JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk. ETHAN wakes it up. The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its connection. It prompts ETHAN along: "

"(N) The answer: "
"(M) SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND"
"(N) He tries a few more, quickly -- ""job,"" ""jobs,"" ""joblist.com,"" but nothing comes up. He tries something else -- ""scroll usenet groups."" "
"(N) The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed, by the hundreds. That's not going anywhere. "
"(N) ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of ""job 314"" he should add to the others on his computer screen. He MUMBLES. "
"(C) ETHAN"

"(D) Would you remove your hat please? (T) 00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,702"

"(S) INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY"
"(N) The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting upright. He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn. The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. "
"(N) Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is VACUUMING. MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. "

"(D) I thought I was going to see Max. (T) 00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:36,475"

"(D) You misunderstood. No one sees Max. (T) 00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,143"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Then what am I doing here? (T) 00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:41,021"

"(C) MAX"
"(D) Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? (T) 00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:28,194(T) 00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,738"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. (T) 00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,200"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a paradox.

"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. (T) 00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:05,481"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) It's quite out of the question. (T) 00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:13,322"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. (T) 00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,911(T) 00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,623"

"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Like Job? (T) 00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:37,888"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Ah, but, we're asking about you. (T) 00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:10,694(T) 00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,103"
"(C) ETHAN"

"(C) MAX"
"(D) Why, may I ask? (T) 00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,362"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) That's the question I want to ask Job. (T) 00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:56,365"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I don't know Job any more than he knows me. (T) 00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:02,163"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. (T) 00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:03,747(T) 00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:06,375"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) Why should I? (T) 00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,668"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.

"(C) MAX"
"(D) It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. (T) 00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:33,986(T) 00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,405(T) 00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,992"

"(N) One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the parking area of the headquarters building. Second truck roars past. LUTHER watches it go. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company manuals with names like ""COSMOS"" and ""SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICE."" "
"(N) One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn GUARD, who's finishing his sentence. GUARD (on screen) --and it did not go off in twenty-one! "
"(N) LUTHER turns to a screen on another computer and searches through a complex facilities menu. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) (M) (mouths) Twenty-one, twenty-one --"
"(N) He finds what he's looking for and double clicks on it. A red box on his screen lights up -- "
"(S) INT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY "
"(C) GUARD RANDALL"
"(D) Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Let's move! "
"(N) ETHAN turns and looks at one of the FIREMEN behind them -- it's CLAIRE. CLAIRE and KRIEGER follow ETHAN/GUARD to corridor. "
"(S) INT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY "
"(N) CLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing a business suit underneath. She clips an ID tag to her breast pocket. "
"(N) She pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer printout of a man's ID photo. She stares at the face, studying it. "
"(S) INT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY "
"(N) She sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper. It's the man whose picture she looked at in the storage room. She sits next to him. "
"(N) He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then goes back to his paper. "
"(N) He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a perfume sampler. She dumps the clear liquid contents into his coffee. He turns back and hands her part of the paper. CLAIRE smiles. "
"(N) She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. "
"(N) He smiles. But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of shiny gray metallic tape. CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE MAN drinks up and leaves the table. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a blueprint of the inside of the building. A cursor begins to flash in one of the rooms. LUTHER smiles. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Hi there. "
"(S) INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Air conditioning's through here! "
"(N) They turn a corner, walking directly past -- "
"(C) CIA ANALYST"
"(D) William Donloe. "
"(S) INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing. ETHAN putting the mask in a bag. "
"(C) GUARD"
"(D) Where's the other guy? (T) 00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:23,547"
"(N) ETHAN turns. Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with the other. He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Zero body count. (T) 00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,968"
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) (M) (a threat) We'll see. (T) 00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:29,803(T) 01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:04,482"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Time up. "
"(N) ETHAN releases him and walks away. "
"(S) INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY "
"(N) The first climb is straight up. KRIEGER cups his hands under ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to climb. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving horizontally now. They reach a juncture and turn right. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast. Luther, I'm going in. Don't disappoint me...Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence. (T) 01:01:10,506 --> 01:01:12,716(T) 01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:19,390(T) 01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:32,278(T) 01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:36,240(T) 01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:18,759(T) 01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:22,693"
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct. A laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- crossing every which way. ETHAN looks down, through the net. "
"(N) He can see the computer room below and the top of the TECHNICIAN'S head. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of his hands. KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- sided, pyramid shaped glass object. "
"(N) ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what it is -- a prism. "
"(N) The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the shaft. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing. When it appears ready to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. "
"(N) The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. "
"(N) The screw is pulled up, through the shaft. Now the whole shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. "
"(N) It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. "
"(N) A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees. A gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the tube, cooling the room. "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY"
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY"
"(N) It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw earlier. No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. "
"(N) At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his ankles and understand. "
"(N) He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer. Suddenly ETHAN is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the ANALYST enters the room. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead -- "
"(C) TECHNICIAN"
"(D) Oh, God. (T) 01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:09,713(T) 01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,820"
"(N) He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again. Puzzled, sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY "
"(N) Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the alarm systems with a card-key. They HUM back to life efficiently, a light flashing: "
"(M) INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON"
"(S) INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in front of the computer. "
"(N) A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the set of pulleys. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out on his forehead. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) He blinks, unable to believe this. He curls himself into a situp and looks up, into the shaft. "
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) KRIEGER sees the predicament. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor. Slowly, KRIEGER drops him another few feet. Now ETHAN's lower than the terminal and still three feet away from it. He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what ETHAN sees. "
"(N) He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and begins to whisper. We hear only the moist, airy sound of his breath, not the words. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Type this password: AW96B6. Return. Go to the files menu, find the NOC list file. Open ""NOC List."" Put your diskette in. Double click on the NOC list. (T) 01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:15,845(T) 01:01:19,515 --> 01:01:22,852"
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly. He reaches out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it and starts typing, softly. "
"(N) The computer HUMS, activated. ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy drive. "
"(N) The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR. ETHAN winces, even that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances. "
"(N) But no alarms go off. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) LUTHER cranes his head again to see the computer terminal through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint. He WHISPERS more commands."
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Ok, good! It's scrolling. 0K, now we're going to download. Edit menu. Select ""copy to disc"". You're downloading. When it's all green it's done. (T) 01:03:00,491 --> 01:03:01,450(T) 01:03:31,147 --> 01:03:32,148"
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY"
"(N) ETHAN types in the contends, presses enter and the screen displays a comforting message: "
"(M) DOWNLOADING"
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Holy mother of God. (T) 01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:46,217"
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) KRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope. His eyes suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. "
"(N) It's a rat. KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back. Neither moves. Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls forward, inquisitive. "
"(N) KRIEGER's eyes water, his nose twitches. He's about to sneeze. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) LUTHER pulls himself together and WHISPERS another command into the microphone. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) You've done it. Eject it. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN ignores it. But below him, he sees the floor tiles, four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal. "
"(N) His eyes widen as he realizes something -- "
"(S) INT. CIA - MEN'S - DAY "
"(N) A toilet FLUSHES, smashing the silence, and the TECHNICIAN staggers out of the bathroom. He goes to the sink and throws some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade. "
"(N) He walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) On one of LUTHER'S laptops, the blinking cursor starts to move down a corridor. LUTHER speaks into his microphone. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) He's rolling. Get moving! (T) 01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,109(T) 01:05:01,237 --> 01:05:02,613"
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN is near the ceiling, but KRIEGER isn't pulling any more. ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull him up. KRIEGER shakes his head no. "
"(N) ETHAN gestures -- ""WHAT?!"" "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) The cursor is halfway across the screen. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) Get out of there -- get out of there --"
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN still dangles. Holding the rope with one hand, KRIEGER holds out his other, demanding something. He wants the disk. "
"(S) INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY "
"(N) The blinking cursor is near the edge of the screen and LUTHER is sweating. "
"(C) LUTHER"
"(D) He's at the vault - get moving! 1 yellow, 2 yellows...Toast! (T) 01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:00,074(T) 01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,349"

"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Merci. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We're not outta here yet. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY "
"(N) He turns to close the door behind him and in so doing just misses seeing ETHAN'S head as it is pulled back up into the ceiling. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) INT. DUCT - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN throws smoke cannisters and he and KRIEGER crawl frantically back through the duct, the way they came. "
"(S) INT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY "
"(N) CLAIRE walks quickly past the GUARDS in the reception area and out of the building. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY "
"(M) KEYSTROKE LOG -- FILE DOWNLOAD 11/18/95 9.58 AM"
"(N) And it goes on. The TECHNICIAN'S eyes widen in disbelief. He spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest telephone. "
"(S) INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY "
"(N) In the communications room, tempers are running a little high. KITTRIDGE is on his feet, berating his staff. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Think, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face! What does Ethan Hunt want?! "
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list! (T) 01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,135"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Okay! "
"(N) Now it's coming together in KITTRIDGE'S mind and a horrible thought occurs to him. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) And where is the list vulnerable? "
"(N) There is nervous silence for a moment. Behind KITTRIDGE, on the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) (M) (joking) Other than here. (T) 01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:47,106(T) 01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:06,041"
"(N) Nervous laughter goes around the table. It fades. On the other side of the room, the AGENT who answered the phone turns, receiver in hand, face ashen. "
"(N) He holds the phone out to KITTRIDGE, terrified, the bearer of extremely bad news. "
"(N) They all turn slowly and look at him. He holds the phone out to KITTRIDGE, shaking slightly. "
"(C) AGENT"
"(D) It's for you. (T) 01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:01,871(T) 01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:28,374(T) 01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:45,808"

"(D) Kittridge, yup? (T) 01:11:47,768 --> 01:11:48,811"
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. VIRGINIA ROAD - DAY "
"(N) It may be a HUMAN SCREAM or it may be a SIREN'S WAIL but it echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck ROARS away from the headquarters building, making its escape. "
"(S) INT. FIRE TRUCK - MOVING - DAY "
"(N) ETHAN looks at CLAIRE, who is jammed into the seat next to him. She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted. "
"(N) ETHAN just looks straight ahead and to CLAIRE. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY "
"(N) He gets up and walks to the door, where HARRY BARNES hovers. KITTRIDGE lowers his voice, it's barely audible. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)"
"(D) (M) (to Barnes) You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops. Understand? It never happened. (T) 01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:16,505(T) 01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:18,174"
"(C) BARNES"
"(D) What about him...? (T) 01:10:17,636 --> 01:10:18,762(T) 01:12:18,299 --> 01:12:19,800"
"(N) He gestures to the TECHNICIAN, who watches them anxiously. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day. Just mail him his clothes. (T) 01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:23,637(T) 01:12:23,762 --> 01:12:25,389"
"(N) He leaves. Barnes turns to the TECHNICIAN, who looks up at him anxiously. "
"(M) CUT TO:"
"(S) EXT. LONDON - NIGHT "
"(S) INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT "
"(N) This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in. ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max. He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk. "
"(N) CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. "
"(N) KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) You contacting your buyer? (M) (no answer) Ethan? (T) 01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:05,679"
"(N) From the desk, ETHAN glances up. Then goes back to the computer. KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. "
"(C) KRIEGER (CONT'D)"
"(D) Ethan? Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? (T) 01:13:27,243 --> 01:13:29,286"
"(N) ETHAN ignores him, working. His computer jams with static as it connects to a BBS. The screen blinks and displays the familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted Max. When it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next code. He begins to type. "
"(N) KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of Ethan's hands to the floor. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) You're not going to any meeting without me. (T) 01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:40,928(T) 01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:41,215"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) My contact is extremely shy. (T) 01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,640(T) 01:13:43,884 --> 01:13:46,512"
"(N) He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the ""ENTER"" button. "
"(N) LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN sighs and stands up. KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this. (T) 01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:52,810(T) 01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,396"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) Krieger. (T) 01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,231(T) 01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:57,898"
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue (T) 01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:24,185"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Don't you mean this? (T) 01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:04,572"
"(N) He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical disk. He puts it back in his jacket pocket. "
"(N) KRIEGER stares for a second. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) That's not it. That's not the list. (T) 01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:06,907"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) What's the matter, you don't know this trick? (T) 01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:10,286"
"(N) He holds the jacket pocket wide open, for KRIEGER to look into. KRIEGER does. The pocket is empty. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) (M) (mock surprise) Where did it go?! It's GONE! (T) 01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:25,217(T) 01:14:29,722 --> 01:14:30,681"
"(N) ETHAN walks over to CLAIRE, reaches into the pocket of the trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) But not too far! (T) 01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:38,898"
"(N) He palms the disk in his right hand. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) I know what you're thinking, Krieger. You're thinking, back in the computer room -- I was up here -- he was down there -- . He was carrying two discs. (T) 01:14:43,277 --> 01:14:45,738(T) 01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:47,656(T) 01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,242(T) 01:14:52,953 --> 01:14:54,663(T) 01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:58,042"
"(N) While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from KRIEGER. When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again. He holds up his left hand. It's there now. "
"(C) ETHAN (CONT'D)"
"(D) So hard to keep track of these things. (T) 01:15:00,377 --> 01:15:02,379"
"(N) ETHAN shows his hands -- now both are empty. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) (M) (fuming) Where is it? (T) 01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:20,045(T) 01:15:03,672 --> 01:15:04,715"
"(N) ETHAN pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) I thought you had it! Do you actually think I'd let you have the NOC list? (T) 01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,441"
"(N) KRIEGER just stares at him, shaken. CLAIRE laughs. KRIEGER looks at her. He turns completely red. When he looks back at ETHAN, ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand. "
"(C) KRIEGER"
"(D) Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and IÃ­ll cut your throat. (T) 01:15:24,443 --> 01:15:26,904"
"(N) He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms out, SLAMMING the door behind him. ETHAN picks up the Bible and sees Drake Hotel. "
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I've never worked with him. I'm sorry, Ethan. (T) 01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:09,183(T) 01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:16,357(T) 01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:24,198(T) 01:14:28,596 --> 01:14:29,597(T) 01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,105(T) 01:16:04,066 --> 01:16:05,526(T) 01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:13,909(T) 01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,293"
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) We did what we had to do. (T) 01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:29,550"
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) I'm going to try and get some sleep. (T) 01:16:31,427 --> 01:16:33,888"
"(N) She leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving ETHAN and LUTHER alone. "
"(M) ANGLE "
"(N) ETHAN waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off carefully. "
"(N) He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his jacket pocket. "

""Thou shall not covet thy NeighbourÃ­s wife"", Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the worldÃ­s lovers, heÃ­s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - ""does she feel the same way I do?""(T) 01:35:36,989 --> 01:35:38,491(T) 01:35:39,783 --> 01:35:41,202(T) 01:35:41,285 --> 01:35:44,038(T) 01:35:45,247 --> 01:35:48,792(T) 01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:56,258(T) 01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:29,208"

"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Fold it. Fold it tight."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) ArenÃ­t you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six."
"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) DonÃ­t flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too.(T) 01:36:29,959 --> 01:36:30,960"

"(C) PHELPS"
"(D) Ethan - IÃ­ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you."
"(N) PHELPS shoots CLAIRE. Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN. The gun is lost. PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground. His watch alarm beeps rapidly. He turns, goes up the stairs and..."
"(N) ETHAN goes to CLAIRE. ETHAN Claire...Hey..."
"(C) CLAIRE"
"(D) This stuff is so sticky."
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Claire."

"(S) INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY"

"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the smooth surface of the train. "
"(N) Now for the tough part. Using the suction cups, PHELPS slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes. "
"(N) He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the ENGINEER. "
"(N) Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his belt."
"(N) He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train. From out of the fog, a helicopter approaches. "
"(N) PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going. In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the English Channel. His eyes widen. "
"(S) INT. HELICOPTER - DAY"
"(N) KRIEGER is at the controls. He sees the approaching tunnel as well. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position. Looking up, he sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. "
"(N) ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. "
"(N) A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. "
"(N) He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way. Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. "
"(S) INT. HELICOPTER - DAY"
"(N) KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching. He gestures to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over PHELPS and then back to him. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the roof. "

"(N) They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. "
"(S) INT. HELICOPTER - DAY"

"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY"
"(N) PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the train. PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on. "
"(M) -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! "
"(S) INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes one last time. This time it says: "

"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY"
"(N) For a moment, we see no one. No ETHAN. No PHELPS. Moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone. "
"(N) They're dangling from either side of it. "
"(N) PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train. ETHAN reaches for the other cup. "
"(N) The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER pushing it up to full speed again. "
"(N) But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train. "
"(S) EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY"
"(N) He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction. "
"(N) Another train. "
"(N) At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by. "
"(N) The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS misses the skid. "
"(N) KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ETHAN with the rotor. PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel. SPARKS and chunks of cement fly. "
"(N) KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly. ETHAN uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. "
"(N) PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls out -- "
"(N) PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles frantically for his gun. "
"(C) ETHAN"
"(D) Red light, green light. Asta Lasagna mother fucker. (T) 01:42:37,827 --> 01:42:39,161(T) 01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:41,747"
"(N) ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the copter's underbelly and turns away from it. "
"(N) PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- "
"(N) The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. "
"(N) ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly drained. "
"(S) INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY"
"(N) KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by BARNES. LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. "

"(N) MAX looks up, stunned. KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to wait for her to speak. "
"(N) When she finally does, she's almost charming. "
"(C) MAX"
"(D) My lawyers will have a field day with this. Entrapment, jurisdictional conflicts -- (T) 01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:48,647"
"(N) KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as friendly. "
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of this one. (T) 01:43:51,484 --> 01:43:54,778"
"(C) MAX"
"(D) I'm sure we can find something I have that you need. (T) 01:43:30,087 --> 01:43:34,425(T) 01:43:57,531 --> 01:44:02,119"
"(C) KITTRIDGE"
"(D) You know, I would love to try. "
"(S) EXT. LONDON PUB - DAY"
"(N) LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while he sips a beer. A television screen is featuring follow-up coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in the chunnel. Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was there were no other fatalaties. There are intermittent sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of arrivals and departures. ETHAN into shot. He sits beside LUTHER. "
"(C) LUTHER"
