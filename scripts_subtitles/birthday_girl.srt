00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,966
Hello.

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,558
No.

3
00:00:53,787 --> 00:01:00,249
Running, reading...
going out, staying in...

4
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,261
the countryside...

5
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,388
films... if they're good.

6
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,101
Intelligent, of course.
Kind...

7
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,038
pretty, I suppose.
But it's not critical.

8
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,769
<i>Someone you can really talk to.</i>

9
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,212
I think communication is key.

10
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,216
<i>The most beautiful girl
in the world</i>

11
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,986
<i>Picks my ties out
she eats my candy</i>

12
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,993
<i>She drinks my brandy</i>

13
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,859
<i>The most beautiful girl
in the wo-o-rld...</i>

14
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,592
<i>I came from Moscow,</i>

15
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,261
and, um...
<i>I'm looking for perfect husband.</i>

16
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,635
<i>Older than me, about 5 years.</i>

17
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,402
<i>Hello. My name is Tanya.</i>

18
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,410
<i>I don't want anything fat.</i>

19
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,843
<i>I don't like stingy man.</i>

20
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,345
<i>... like Johnny Depp.</i>

21
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,405
<i>He's got passion.
He's good-looking.</i>

22
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,644
<i>... who care about family,
who loves children.</i>

23
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,980
<i>I like friends.</i>

24
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,247
<i>I do wild things.</i>

25
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,186
<i>I'm actually looking for somebody
who could control that.</i>

26
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,851
<i>I like "Earth, Wind, and Fire,"
my favorite group.</i>

27
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>... To the one and only
beautiful girl in the world</i>

28
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,102
<i>Okay, when you think about it,</i>

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,331
<i>England is just a small island.</i>

30
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,568
<i>I mean, I know that gives you
about 20 million girls to choose from.</i>

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,008
<i>But if you live in a small town
and you work long hours,</i>

32
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,605
<i>you're just not gonna get
the chance to meet them all.</i>

33
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,548
<i>But I suppose I never
really believed in that stuff</i>

34
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,212
<i>about falling in love
with the girl next-door.</i>

35
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,017
<i>I mean, for a start,
I never had a girl next-door.</i>

36
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,650
<i>But where does it say
that you have to meet</i>

37
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,662
<i>the love of your life
in the local supermarket?</i>

38
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,967
<i>We all have someone in our past</i>...

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,633
<i>one skeleton, if you like.</i>

40
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,542
We've all got at least one person,
as it were, under the patio.

41
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,309
Not literally, of course.

42
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:08,013
<i>I should say that some people,
on the face of it,</i>

43
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,317
<i>might not understand
what I'm doing.</i>

44
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,982
<i>They might think it was a bit sad.</i>

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,088
<i>I think it's quite a brave move.</i>

46
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,657
<i>Quite a brave...
reasonable thing to do.</i>

47
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,184
<i>Attention please.

49

00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,091
I'm... I'm John.

56
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:02,397
Right.
Is that everything?

57
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,402
Yes.

58
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,705
It's about 40 miles from here.

59
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:19,148
Don't know if you've had a chance
to look at the map.

60
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,119
Close to London,
but it's a city in itself.

61
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,385
I'm having a problem with ants.

62
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:27,084
It's the warmer weather.

63
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:31,061
<i>I can't seem to find the nest.</i>

64

65
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,299
Yes.

66
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:42,705
I mean ants, you know?
I'm having a problem with ants.

67
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,402
Honestly.

68

69
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,218
<i>So, you're a smoker.</i>

70
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,482
<i>I thought you were a nonsmoker.</i>

71
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,581
Sorry. Do you understand
what I'm saying?

72
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,387
- Yes.
- <i>Good. Good.</i>

73
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,191
- Or should I speak slower?
- Yes.

74
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,755
Do you... Do you follow
or should I speak slower?

75
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,596
Yes.

76
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,639
Um... are you a giraffe?

77
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,304
Yes.

78
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,643
Oh, Jesus.

79
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,309
Jesus Christ!

80
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,655
This is John Buckingham from St. Albans.

81
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,995

That's for you.

90
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,161
I can't take that.

91
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,166
I can't take that. 

92
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,236
I'm... I'm not really a ring guy.

93

Please.

94
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:39,803
Okay.
That's no big deal.

95
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:44,212

workmanlike year for him...</i>

<i>much the same as last year."</i> 

166
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,754
Thank you.
I think that's very fair.

167
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,560
<i>And...</i>

168
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,365
go.

169
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,106
Good. Good. Very good.

170
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:06,940
So, how did that feel?
John?

171
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,914
It feels...
It felt good. Weird.

172
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:15,078
It's called
"Trust... And... Letting Go."

173
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,912
<i>Trust... And...</i>

174
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,323
<i>Letting Go.</i>

175
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,782
<i>Made you a cup of tea.</i>

176
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,477
Are you okay?

177
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,076
Bahd-day.

178
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,883
Sorry?

179
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:38,361
Mm-mm.
Today... bahd-day.

180
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,660
Bahd-day.

181
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,826
I-I don't understand.

182
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:48,900
Mm.

183
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,771
- Today.
- Today.

184
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,403
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

185
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,538
- Birth-day.
- Yes. Happy birthday.

186
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,876
Par-ty.

187
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,146
- Yes! Party. Party.
- Par-ty!

188
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,413
Yeah.

189
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,954
Party.

190
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,116
Yes. Party, party.

191
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:16,157
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

192
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,967
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

193
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,372
<i>Happy birthday, dear Nadia</i>

194
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,949
Let me get it.

195
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,224
I'm sorry I'm late.

196
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:47,930
I told you I'd make it.

197
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,826
I told you she was beautiful.

198
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,099
John!

199
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,471
Hey, John!
John, John, John, my man!

200
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,975
Hey, let me look at you.

201
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:01,068
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

202
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:04,308
<i>Beautiful.
One... One minute.</i>

203
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:08,113
Nadia, meet my new guitarist, Alexei.

204
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,086
Alexei, this is Nadia.

205
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,850
You'll love him.
He's a riot.

206
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,324
Happy Birthday.

207
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:16,858
How's that, huh?

208
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,295
We can't drink our own piss,
can we, John? Hey?

209
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,560
Hang on.
Um, sorry. Who are you?

210
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,296
Glasses, get some glasses.

211
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,536
Uh, what are you...
what are you doing here?

212
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,665
Sorry, eh, you've lost me.

213
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,006
Hold on.
He doesn't speak Russian?

214
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,942
- No.
- He can't speak Russian!

215
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,106
You don't speak Russian?

216
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,648
Nothing?

217
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:40,308
Say, uh, say these are my friends.

218
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,114
How do you say "friends" in English?

219
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,155
Friends, friends!
Nadia, Yuri... friends.

220
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,852
He's got a wicked pad.

221
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,191
I wanted to say
you might be coming,

222
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:52,627
but...

223
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,562
Yes. Nadia. Okay.

224
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:56,964
She wants to tell you that,
you know,

225
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,900
her English is so shit,

226
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,565
<i>no one speak Russian, so it's very,
very hard for her, you know.</i>

227
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,131
The light... for the cake.

228
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:08,406
Okay, Nadia... happy birthday!

229
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,882
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

230
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,048
I need to know who you are first.

231
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,715
We are Russian.

232
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,191
Yes, I know.

233
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,591
Good.

234
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,253
<i>A- and?</i>

235
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,525
<i>And what?
Oh, from the beginning.</i>

236
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:28,690
<i>Okay...</i>

237
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,859
Nadia is my little cousin,

238
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,768
<i>except she's not my little cousin,
but we say "little cousin."</i>

239
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:34,896
Is it good?

240
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,431
So you're...
you're both Nadia's cousins?

241
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:43,276
<i>No, no, no,
Alexei doesn't speak English.</i>

242
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,372
<i>We are actors.</i>

243
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,542
Although he is actor/musician.

244
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,016
He is very, very good.

245
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,281
<i>I'm not so good.
I just strum along.</i>

246
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,050
<i>He makes me look like a retard.</i>

247
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,784
He smokes me.

248
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,918
<i>No, I don't mean he "smokes" me...
you know?</i>

249
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,758
What?

250
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,560
You... You say "smoke" in England?

251
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:03,259
No.

252
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,097
No, okay.
So I can say "he smokes me," huh?

253
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,536
So I come to England
with other actors to make shows.

254
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,597
<i>And I meet this crazy guy
from Novgorod.</i>

255
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:15,635
<i>I tell him about you,
about chicken, and birthday cake.</i>

256
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,271
<i>And here we are!</i>

257
00:25:20,985 --> 00:25:23,647
So how... how long
will you be in England?

258
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,882
Oh, plans. Come on.

259
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,256
Plans are for architects, politicians,
not for us.

260
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,387
Uh, but you must have
a visa or something?

261
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:35,330
Are you asking me for my documents?

262
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,129
- No.
- Yes, you are...

263
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:40,193
Get this.
He's asking me for my passport.

264
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:42,739
Okay, John, yes.

265
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,331
I've put on a few pounds.

266
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,808
Come on, John.

267
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,572
Don't tease him.

268
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,135
John, please.

269
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,613
Can I have a light?

270
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,947
<i>So... John, you have nothing
to say to your fiancée?</i>

271
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,886
Maybe to a wife of 40 years,
I can understand.

272
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:01,789
But... come on. You speak
and I will translate if you want, okay?

273
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,759
I will help you.

274
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,031
Hello.

275
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,365
- Hello.
- Hello.

276
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,201
<i>"Hello."
She say "hello" to you, John.</i>

277
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,831
<i>It's good. Go for it.</i>

278
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,035
Um...

279
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:23,480
Do you like England?

280
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,015
That's a classic.

281
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,381
Do you like England?

282
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,783
Yes.

283
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,050
Hey, whew!
Thanks God she say "yes"!

284
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,353
Go, go, go, go.

285
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,730
Can't think of anything.

286
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,333
Tell him I have a secret to tell.

287
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,072
<i>Okay, now, Nadia...
she has secret to tell.</i>

288
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,670
What?

289
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,723
<i>Okay, she says that
she watched you at airport...</i>

290
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,689
<i>I saw you standing there
by the gate...</i>

291
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,264
<i>She says,
When I was a little girl,</i>

292
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:22,705
<i>my father had these beautiful,
old glasses for watching the birds.</i>

293
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,298
Binoculars.

294
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:28,243
<i>Binoculars. Okay.
That he had kept from the war.</i>

295
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,276
<i>I would pretend binoculars
was a camera,</i>

296
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,787
<i>and I would take pictures
of the things I loved.</i>

297
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,084
<i>The day before I left Russia,</i>

298
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,853
<i>my father gave me
the old binoculars...</i>

299
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,623
<i>And he said that when I was to see you,
I was to stand far away...</i>

300
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:57,334
<i>And look at you
through the binoculars...</i>

301
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:00,571
<i>and if you were a bad person,
I could run away.</i>

302
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,907
<i>She say,
She took picture...</i>

303
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:08,781
<i>In the head.
Took mental picture.</i>

304
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:19,054
Okay. Take picture.

305
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,428
Closer. Closer.
Okay.

306
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,127
Hey! Is like Hollywood, eh?
Come on.

307
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,569
<i>A 1... 2... 3! 3!</i>

308
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,643
John.

309
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,757
John.

310
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,536
John.

311
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,440
Huh?

312
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:48,013
John...

313
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,532
John, John, John, John, John!

314
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:44,798
John! We can see you.
Come in. Come in.

315
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,496
<i>John.</i>

316
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,464
Johnny!

317
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,771
Some rabbit.

318
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:55,778
Hangover medicine for yesterday.

319
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,838
- You want some?
- No. No, thank you.

320
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,127
Hey, John! John!
Hey, John!

321
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:26,632
Look... John!

322
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,737
You've got something on your face.

323
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:39,217
Stop that! That hurt!

324
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:46,320
One... two... three!

325
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,545
I won! I won!

326
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,488
I won! I won!

327
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,396
Hey!

328
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:23,758
Hey! Hey!

329
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:31,968
What are you doing?!
I couldn't breathe!

330
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,703
You bastard!

331
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,609
Don't ever touch me again!

332
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:39,842
Hey, I told you to leave her alone.

333
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,646
Can't you just leave her alone?

334
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,051
Keep out of this.

335
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,830
<i>So... l'm really sorry,</i>

336
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,565
<i>but I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.</i>

337
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,274
Oh, I-I'm sorry, John.

338
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,139
It... It's not you.

339
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:12,342
Oh, it's my fault.
I should have maybe come alone?

340
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,247
It's okay.
You can stay tonight.

341
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:18,516
I'm sorry.
I don't know him that much.

342
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,423
<i>Okay. I see you
tomorrow morning, we go.</i>

343
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,824
Good night, Yuri.

344
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:26,419
Thank you very much, John.
You've been very kind.

345
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,022
- <i>Thank you. Thank you, John.</i>
- John.

346
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,193
<i>Good night, John.</i>

347
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,023
- I'm sorry, John.
- What happened?

348
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,154
You're throwing me out?!

349
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,324
Sit down! Sit down!

350
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,560
What's he saying?!

351
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,034
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit!

352
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,832
- <i>Alexei! Alexei!</i>
- <i>Leave her alone!</i>

353
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:43,031
You think you're better than me?

354
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,075
I beg you.

355
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:50,605
Now we'll see.

356
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,206
Let's see if he's got any balls.

357
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,477
Put the fucking kettle down!

358
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:55,916
What?

359
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:01,849
You with your nice job
and your big house,

360
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:04,985
and you still have to pay for a woman.

361
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,757
I don't understand.

362
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,130
You bought her.
Let's see what she's worth to you.

363
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,190
Oh, Jesus!

364
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:13,531
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

365
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,004
What do you want?!
What do you want?

366
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,870
Bread! Money!

367
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:38,552
<i>Ah, John?</i>

368
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:42,656
<i>John, this is Robert Moseley,
head of Southeast new business.</i>

369
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,893
Robert, this is John Buckingham.

370
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,457
- Hello, John.
- Hello.

371
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,834
<i>Thought you could give us
a tour this morning,</i>

372
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,236
sort of be our Indian guide?

373
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:50,568
- Right.
- Do you play?

374
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,304
Yes, I do.

375
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,844
That's John...

376
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,507
he's always surprising us
with his hidden talents, isn't he?

377
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,550
I was in a band.
Keyboards.

378
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:03,916
Sort of like... very loud,
uh, very loud Marillion.

379
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:07,150
- Oh, yeah. "Script For a Jester's Tear."
- Yes.

380
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:11,024
<i>Come on, maestro.
Give us a tune.</i>

381
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:17,864
I'll give you a tune later.

382
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,199
Take the ball and run with it, John.

383
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:24,535
Right.

384
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,668
Good morning, John.
Hey, give us a tune?

385
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,340
- I'll give you a tune later.
- All right.

386
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,975
This is the, uh...

387
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,111
This is, um...

388
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:39,451
This is where we're doing
"Trust...

389
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,150
"Trust And Letting Go."

390
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,489
<i>Yeah. We're not doing this
till the fourth quarter.</i>

391
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,289
<i>The result...
has it been beneficial?</i>

392
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,727
<i>Yes.</i>

393
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,027
<i>It's really weird at first.</i>

394
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,795
It's sort of, um,
exciting and frightening at the same time.

395
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,530
Wouldn't you say, John?

396
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,730
Yes.

397
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,171
No, no, we're starting to see results.

398
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,334
<i>This is Karen who's, uh,
taking it.</i>

399
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,172
- Hi. Robert.
- Hi. Hi.

400
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,236
So, what are you doing here, exactly?

401
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:06,942
<i>It's called "Trust And Letting Go."
It's a kind of game...</i>

402
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,245
Excuse me.

403
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,255
<i>Hey, John, Moseley's here.</i>

404
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:16,622
Yeah, I'll give you a tune later.

405
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,267
It's weird, isn't it?

406
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,930
Very good. So if you'd like
to swap places with your partners,

407
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:03,666
we'll try a bit of mutuality.

408
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,732
<i>Get into your place...
and brace.</i>

409
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,608
<i>And arms penguin...</i>

410
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,808
<i>and in the back, I want you
to really flex your knees.</i>

411
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,545
<i>Be ready...
Be ready to catch them.</i>

412
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:20,113
<i>Okay? And... go.</i>

413
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,475
<i>I am so sorry, John.
So sorry.</i>

414
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,079
Come on, you big orange bastard!

415
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:49,311
Live!

416
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,482
Tell him he's got what he wanted

417
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:25,111
and to let her go.

418
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:28,157
Thank you, John.
Thank you very much, John.

419
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,569
Guess.

420
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,837
Fifty thousand.

421
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,813
Sixty-four thousand, eight hundred.

422
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:27,611
There's over ninety grand here.

423
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,379
Yes! Yes! Yes!

424
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:37,388
Split it up three ways.

425
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:43,097
- You owe me 150 pounds.
- What for?

426
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,465
I've been shelling out
for you all week.

427
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:49,972
What have you bought me?

428
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,203
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe...

429
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:56,439
when we went to see "Cats,"
who paid?

430
00:41:56,513 --> 00:42:00,973
That's normal friendship stuff.
Tightwad.

431
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,146
What was "Cats" like?

432
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,283
"Cats"... not bad.

433
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,350
Yeah, it was so-so.

434
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,896
I'd give it three stars.

435
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:18,264
- The sets were good.
- The sets were excellent.

436
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,326
Everything was very big...

437
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:24,170
the trash, coke cans...
so you felt cat-size.

438
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,799
It was really clever.

439
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:41,090
So...

440
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,625
tell me...

441
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:49,029
how many times
did you have to fuck him?

442
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,567
Two?

443
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,660
Three?

444
00:42:56,206 --> 00:43:01,200
You scared me with the kettle.

445
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:14,789
How are you doing?
You okay?

446
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:22,426
Listen, uh,
let me show you something.

447
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,593
Maybe this is gonna make it easy,
you know?

448
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,637
Look, uh, look...

449
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:31,504
<i>uh, this is, uh, German guy.</i>

450
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:39,482
Okay? This is, uh, Switzerland.

451
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:45,146
<i>This is, uh, Greek...
Greek guy.</i>

452
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:49,249
This is, uh, a croupier.

453
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,660
<i>This is a fat guy.
You see? No.</i>

454
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,756
<i>And this is, uh, this is you.</i>

455
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,544
<i>Listen, John, you know, uh...</i>

456
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,740
<i>they weren't... you know,
they weren't as good as you are.</i>

457
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,375
You... you shouldn't feel so bad, huh?

458
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,188
Okay, um, I need this.

459
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,590
Thank you.

460
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,523
<i>Thank you.</i>

461
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,764
It's enough, isn't it?

462
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,705
We can stop now.

463
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:40,766
Do you want to stop?

464
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,244
Yes.

465
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,079
Well, stop then.

466
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,549
What's this?

467
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:51,280
What? It's nothing.
I burnt myself.

468
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,652
- Yeah? A rope burn?
- No. I did it cooking.

469
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:55,088
On both wrists?

470
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:57,285
I said I did it cooking.

471
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:01,920
Are you lying?

472
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:04,296
And that story... the binoculars...

473
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:05,459
was that true?

474
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:16,078
I'm going to that arcade.
They've got Gran Turismo.

475
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,443
Have fun.

476
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:34,856
Listen.
I made you something.

477
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:42,371
Put it on.
I want to see if it fits.

478
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,683
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

479
00:45:55,752 --> 00:46:00,519
- Say thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

480
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:17,804
We're going to have a baby.

481
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:18,898
What?

482
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:22,411
Yes. I'm pregnant.

483
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:27,473
- What?
- We're going to have a baby.

484
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:38,184
I've been throwing up for weeks.

485
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:40,388
It's yours.

486
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:43,523
What are we supposed to do
with a baby?

487
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,833
Think of a name for it.

488
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,116
<i>John's been with us for, 
uh, 10 years,</i>

489
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,385
and, uh, I think I speak for us all

490
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:19,758
when I say I hope he, uh,
I hope he gets 10 years.

491
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:22,127
Banking asks a great deal
of an individual.

492
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:27,568
It says, "Here's all this money.
Don't... steal it."

493
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:30,504
We are insured for this sort of thing,
so it's not the money,

494
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:33,804
it's just...
I sat next to him for years,

495
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,607
and, uh, he seemed perfectly normal.

496
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,045
Sort of, good-old John.

497
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:13,959
Great.
You split my fucking lip.

498
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,241
<i>Good morning.
What can I get for you?</i>

499
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,910
<i>Uh, I'll have an espresso with, um...</i>

500
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:39,614
with a small pastry or a croissant.

501
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,351
<i>We only do a croissant
with the continental breakfast.</i>

502
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,950
Uh, just... just give me a coffee.

503
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,464
One coffee.
And for you, sir?

504
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:55,298
<i>He'll have a coffee.</i>

505
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:05,371
It makes it easier, okay?

506
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:09,214
It makes it faster.
I worked it out.

507
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:12,550
If I don't speak English,
the men, they...

508
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,613
they fall faster.

509
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,592
Look, they don't blame you.

510
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,563
When a bank employee does this,
they... they understand.

511
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,226
You get your life back.
Hmm.

512
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:29,829
Anyway, I bet... I bet
you hated the bank, huh?

513
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,568
Why else would you send off for me?

514
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,406
I-if you just wanted sex,
just go to a prostitute.

515
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,605
Well, as it turns out, I did.

516
00:53:43,686 --> 00:53:45,847
- <i>Here we are.</i>
- Lovely.

517
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,823
- Splendid. Thank you.
- I don't want it. Take it back.

518
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:54,090
<i>I'll... I'll have it.</i>

519
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,631
- Lovely.
- Pleasure.

520
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:58,792
Oh, excuse me.
Um...

521
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,301
<i>Where are we?</i>

522
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:02,132
<i>Uh, we're just outside Newbury.</i>

523
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:06,699
Do you know where
the nearest police station is?

524
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,677
<i>Um, that would be Marlborough.</i>

525
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,010
Two junctions in that direction.

526
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:13,981
One or two.
I can't remember.

527
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,416
So about five or ten minutes?

528
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,545
<i>Five or ten minutes.
Not far.</i>

529
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:20,282
Lovely. Perfect.
Thanks.

530
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:21,823
- Pleasure.
- Thank you.

531
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,833
John, uh...

532
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:37,497
John, I... I need your help.

533
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:52,049
You must think 
I'm the biggest pillock in the world.

534
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:53,986
I know you just want to punish me.

535
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:55,990
I do.
I want to very badly.

536
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,549
<i>So, what, y-y-you're...
you're just going to be...</i>

537
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,152
How do you say...

538
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:01,753
vindictive!

539
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:05,267
In every sense.
If at all possible.

540
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:08,326
You can't hurt me more
than I'm hurt already.

541
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:11,669
Well, Nadia,
if it's all the same to you,

542
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,608
I'd like to give it a bash.

543
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,571
My name is not Nadia.

544
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,452
John, in Russia,
there is no work for women.

545
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:32,517
Sometimes you get drawn
into something.

546
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,495
You don't know
how it's going to end.

547
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,361
- Here we go.
- What?

548
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:39,094
No, go on. I've been actually
looking forward to this bit.

549
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,897
What?

550
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,803
"It's so hard in Russia in winter
that we have to eat each other.

551
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,364
<i>"It's so cold that
we have to go to England</i>

552
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,239
and shag people to keep warm."

553
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,245
<i>I'm just saying...
the life there for women is very hard.</i>

554
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,871
No, I'm sure.

555
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,143
The rest of the world is not
like St. Albans, John.

556
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,879
Well, thank Christ for that.

557
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:03,053
So... Alexei...
which I know isn't his name...

558
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,922
- He will be back.
- <i>I beg your pardon?</i>

559
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,791
He left me my ticket and passport.

560
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,058
It's pretty clear
he wants to see me again.

561
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:11,099
Yeah, actually, yes.
Yeah.

562
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,102
I tend to tie up and abandon women
I really want to see again, too.

563
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,731
No, but you tie them up.

564
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:25,810
<i>Well, I was queuing up
at the checkout,</i>

565
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,077
<i>and I think I put my bag
on the floor...</i>

566
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,586
<i>All right, would you like
to give me some details, love?</i>

567
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:35,623
- Where's the toilet?
- What?

568
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:37,852
I'm going to be sick.
Where's the toilet?

569
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,952
- No, you're not.
- I am going to be sick!

570
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,122
Nice one.
How stupid do you think I am?

571
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,187
Where's the toilet?

572
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,665
The what, love?

573
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,961
Where's the toilet?

574
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,061
Through that door, up the stairs,

575
00:56:49,138 --> 00:56:50,867
and it's just on the left.

576
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,405
You're pregnant... aren't you?

577
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:01,535
Can I help you?

578
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,044
Hmm?

579
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:10,107
<i>Sir?
Can I help you?</i>

580
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:14,350
Hmm... no.

581
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:17,017
<i>Thank you.</i>

582
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,777
<i>... and finally, a St. Albans bank clerk
is on the run today</i>

583
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:44,286
<i>after stealing £90,000 in broad daylight
from his own branch.</i>

584
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:45,980
<i>John Buckingham, who lived alone</i>

585
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,250
<i>and had been with the branch
for over 10 years,</i>

586
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,758
<i>was described by bosses
as a "workhorse."</i>

587
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:54,387
<i>Now police are on the lookout
for a bright orange...</i>

588
00:58:54,463 --> 00:58:57,432
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

589
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,401
<i>We'd better get off this motorway.</i>

590
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:03,597
- <i>You got your passport?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

591
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:07,369
- <i>When's your flight?</i>
- <i>It's tomorrow.</i>

592
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:25,920
I want you to know...
I appreciate this.

593
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:32,463
I'm sorry you're a fugitive from justice.

594
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:43,709
John...

595
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:46,270
So when you were a little girl,
you know,

596
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:48,976
<i>running around Russia
with your binoculars on,</i>

597
00:59:49,051 --> 00:59:50,575
did you think,

598
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:54,054
"When I grow up,
I want to fuck loads of strange men,

599
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:56,523
"steal their homes, jobs,
and their dignity,

600
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,958
<i>"but what I really want to do</i>

601
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,691
<i>"is I want to end up on my own,
flat-broke, knocked up, bun in the oven,</i>

602
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,528
back to Moscow on an <i>Aeroflot"?</i>

603
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,295
So tell me, John...

604
01:00:06,368 --> 01:00:07,995
<i>did you say,
"When I grow up,</i>

605
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,470
"what I want is
to still be in this town,

606
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:13,269
"in this job that I hate,
in a house with ants,

607
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,207
"and a big bag of pornography,

608
01:00:15,277 --> 01:00:17,871
<i>"and then I'm going to send off
to Russia for a wife,</i>

609
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,472
and she will fall in love with me"?

610
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:22,414
What did you expect, John?

611
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,352
What did you really expect to happen?

612
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:45,670
Hey, John, they're looking
for this car.

613
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:49,177
This is not a very good plan.

614
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,588
Dear Nadia,

615
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:45,361
You are only girl in world. 

616
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:48,562
I dream to talk.

617
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:53,074
What will happen?

618
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:39,285
How far is the airport?

619
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,652
<i>What are we going to do, John?</i>

620
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,800
"This newly built,
2-bedroom villa is peacefully seated

621
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:07,274
"in a hillside above
the stone-walled village harbour.

622
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,607
It has its own swimming pool."

623
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:50,108
Ah, shit.
I have no more cigarettes.

624
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:57,350
So what happened
between you and the blonde?

625
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,087
What?

626
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,262
The, uh, the short...
the one with the small eyes.

627
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,164
The one in your cupboard.

628
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,827
Hmm?

629
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:10,497
It's none of your business.
She didn't have small eyes.

630
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,096
Did she leave you?

631
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,167
<i>Come on. Hmm?</i>

632
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,839
<i>It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Did she leave you?</i>

633
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:23,851
<i>Who'd she leave you for?
Her boss?</i>

634
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:27,218
Your best friend?

635
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:28,847
A woman!

636
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:31,620
She's dead.

637
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:39,499
Oh, I'm sorry.

638
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:44,804
I'm sorry, I, uh...

639
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:48,639
I... don't know why I said that.

640
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,201
She's not dead at all.

641
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,475
She's not...

642
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,244
- <i>What?!</i>
- Um...

643
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:58,150
I don't know why I said it.
I'm sorry.

644
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,586
<i>She's alive?</i>

645
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,648
She's alive?!

646
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:05,920
Laugh it up.

647
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,025
Go on.

648
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,766
You should stop smoking.

649
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,929
You're pregnant,
and you smoke like a bastard.

650
01:06:16,004 --> 01:06:18,029
- I'm trying to quit.
- <i>Well, it's not working.</i>

651
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:19,596
I smoke more when I'm unhappy.

652
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,006
Nobody's that unhappy.

653
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:24,603
Well, maybe I want to die.

654
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,705
Don't you want me to die?

655
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,181
I don't want anyone to die.

656
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,877
Oh, except for "Small Eyes."

657
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:33,615
Except for "Small Eyes."

658
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:37,557
So why did it end?

659
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,895
I don't know.

660
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:45,229
Mm. What was her name?

661
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,791
What's your name?

662
01:06:58,313 --> 01:07:00,679
<i>Mm...</i>

663
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:31,832
<i>I've got three hours.</i>

664
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,738
Maybe I can buy you a coffee.

665
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,800
<i>No. I-I shouldn't be here anyway.</i>

666
01:08:35,877 --> 01:08:38,004
<i>I think...
I think I'd better just go.</i>

667

What are you going to do?

668

Uh... I don't know.

669

I got this, uh...

670
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:56,059
This is for you.

671
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:58,656
Yeah? No, thanks.

672
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:02,864
No. Please.
Why not, huh?

673

Be careful.

717

No! No, we're not!
It's not what you think!

723

Do it.

737

You hate me.
And I showed you the world.
