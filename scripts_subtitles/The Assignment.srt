1
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:16,647
- I have things to do.
- What do you mean?

2
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,023
I mean get out!

3
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,497
Have you got a light?

4
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,838
It's empty. Just a minute.

5
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:30,304
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

6
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:10,307
My name is Du Foltiere.
Intelligence liaison officer.

7
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:16,736
I understand that you are the
Deputy Chief of Station ClA, Paris.

8
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:20,607
And that you witnessed,
by coincidence, this attack.

9
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:28,034
You told my subordinates that you
recognized the terrorist as Carlos.

10
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,829
- Carlos recognized me.
- Yes.

11
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:40,420
A deputy chief did not recognize
him... but he recognized you.

12
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:48,226
We are both in the same business,
but he was wearing a disguise.

13
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:53,226
Then how are you so sure it was him?

14
00:07:54,196 --> 00:08:00,650
I lit his cigarette.
He was holding my hand.

15
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,740
He grinned at me.

16
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:15,543
Some of the members are exploiting
the oil price differentials.

17
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,847
OPEC has been
very precise in its policy.

18
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:44,117
Is the conference still in progress?
I have an urgent delivery.

19
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:52,046
Sweetheart...
Do you want to live?

20
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,009
Freeze!

21
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,310
My name is Carlos,
and you'll do as I say.

22
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:19,609
- We've got company.
- You, sir, stand up.

23
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:27,332
How does this work?

24
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:32,711
Is it like this? Like this?
Maybe like this?

25
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:35,422
Like this!

26
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:49,980
$20 million in ransom.
The leader claims to be Carlos.

27
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:56,404
He wants the credit, and
the Austrians want a positive lD.

28
00:09:56,575 --> 00:10:02,199
- Who brought up my name? You?
- No, the guy who says he's Carlos.

29
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:08,661
The Austrians want you to lD him
at the airport. Tonight, 2 a.m.

30
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:16,135
- They're gonna fly him to Libya.
- They're going to let him walk?

31
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:21,809
- They've got no choice.
- Let them do like the lsraelis.

32
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:25,311
They're not the lsraelis.

33
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:30,392
Let me explain something
to you, Mickey, really simple.

34
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,148
I'll identify him at the airport.
I'll get really close to him.

35
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:40,664
I'll make one clean shot and
that'll be the end of this prick.

36
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:46,169
- This prick has got 70 hostages.
- Fuck the hostages.

37
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:56,377
- A minimum loss of life.
- There will be no loss of life.

38
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,136
You don't get it, do you?

39
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,851
He's not going to invest
that $20 million in a pension plan.

40
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:13,858
He's going to use it to finance
his next hit, maybe against us.

41
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:19,489
- Let me assemble a team...
- There is no team to assemble.

42
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:26,247
We are out of the assassination
business. I know this is personal.

43
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,836
The guy made you look
like an asshole.

44
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:34,800
I can appreciate your feelings,
but it's not going down on our soil.

45
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:39,301
It's not with our nationals.
It's not our fight.

46
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:11,631
Glad to meet you, Carlos. We're not
in the assassination business now.

47
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:34,322
Come on, my fat friend.
It's only rain. Bring the others.

48
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,533
Is that him?

49
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:44,119
It looks like him, but I can't tell
for sure from here in this rain.

50
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:47,379
I've got to get a little closer.

51
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:58,390
You don't need a hat.
Oh, you want it. Okay.

52
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:05,062
Who do we have to thank
for this plane?

53
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:12,486
Minister of the lnterior.

54
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,990
I'm sorry this had to happen here.
We have no quarrel...

55
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,620
... with your government.
Excuse me.

56
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:32,421
- Pardon, monsieur.
- Do you want another light?

57
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:39,808
We were never properly introduced.
My name is Carlos.

58
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:45,267
- Eat shit and die slow.
- Henry, no!

59
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:55,822
- Don't be seen shaking his hand.
- Such language.

60
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:59,032
Shocking, really.

61
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:09,877
You see this man? ClA. Henry Fields.

62
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:20,510
JERUSALEM, AUGUST 1986

63
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:19,411
How do you feel?

64
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,797
I no speak English.
I am Cuban.

65
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:36,518
You spoke English well enough
to your contact the street vendor.

66
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:43,140
- We are both professionals, Carlos.
- My name is Ramirez.

67
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:51,030
Illich Ramirez, Carlos Sanchez,
Carlos Martinez, alias the Jackal.

68
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:58,035
- I am a tourist, not Carlos.
- What was your target in lsrael?

69
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:05,292
- The Wailing Wall? Temple Mount?
- Tourist. That's all!

70
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:15,592
Listen to me, you piece of shit!
I'm trying to be professional here!

71
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:23,564
But you are in lsraeli hands now,
so don't play games with me.

72
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:29,447
Israeli?

73
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:36,165
You're lsraeli?
You're not Arabs?

74
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:43,290
I'm in an lsraeli prison.
Is that what you're telling me?

75
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:48,377
It's amazing how much
your English has improved.

76
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:52,801
There's been a mistake.
I don't know who you think I am.

77
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:58,315
I am a lieutenant commander
in the United States Navy.

78
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:06,490
I am Annibal Ramirez of the
U.S.S. Yorktown docked in Haifa.

79
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:12,280
I am not lllich or Carlos or
the Jackal or whoever the fuck else!

80
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:22,838
Call the U.S. Embassy and ask
for the Sixth-Fleet liaison officer.

81
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,046
- He'll confirm what I told you.
- Remarkable performance.

82
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:38,180
- I take my hat off to you, Carlos.
- I'll tear your fucking head off!

83
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:43,482
You call the embassy and ask
for the Sixth-Fleet liaison office.

84
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:50,238
And then, you fucker, you go out
and get yourself a very good lawyer.

85
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:59,036
I'm going to sue you so bad, your
grandchildren will still be in debt.

86
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:05,547
If you were an American Officer,
you'd have lD papers and dog tags.

87
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:09,799
I ditched them in an alley
just before your goons got me.

88
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:16,095
A U.S. officer in the Middle East
must travel as a civilian.

89
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:21,314
That's why I said I was Cuban,
not American.

90
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:27,942
You broke my rib, you asshole.
I'll sue you and your government.

91
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:35,533
I'm going to sue every fucking
lsraeli I can get my hands on.

92
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:46,339
I'll sue Menachem Begin,
Moshe Dayan and the B'nai B'rith!

93
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:50,131
Or whatever the fuck you call it!

94
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,602
Yes, good.

95
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:07,773
Oh no...

96
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:11,321
NORFOLK, VA.
ONE MONTH LATER

97
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:21,456
- Good eye, Joey.
- Dad!

98
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:29,009
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

99
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,624
Lt. Commander Ramirez?

100
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,879
Holy cow!

101
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:04,841
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, my name is Jack Shaw.

102
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:08,381
I want to talk to you
about what happened in lsrael.

103
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:15,604
I'll sue the government, the guy
who broke my ribs and Golda Meir.

104
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:19,723
That'll be difficult.
Mrs. Meir is deceased.

105
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:26,404
- Then they'll have to dig her up.
- That's not exactly in my field.

106
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:31,915
- Specifically, I am with the ClA.
- You're ClA?

107
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:36,625
Does the man in this photograph
look familiar to you?

108
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:41,623
Holy shit!

109
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:45,466
That's not me. I know it
looks like me, but it's not me.

110
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:50,265
- I know it's not you, too.
- Is this that Carlos guy?

111
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,515
- Look!
- Joey, get down out of there.

112
00:22:54,689 --> 00:23:00,810
This is the only recent photo we
have of him. Taken half a mile away.

113
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:07,322
It was taken by the lsraelis.
You can't blame them for the mix-up.

114
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:12,287
I hope you're not trying
to talk me out of my lawsuit.

115
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:19,505
They kept me chained up for
two days after I identified myself.

116
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:25,179
- They knew who I was.
- I'm not here about your lawsuit.

117
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:29,558
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Can I finish?

118
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:35,101
Carlos is the single most vicious
terrorist in the whole world.

119
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:42,072
He has carried out the worst
terrorist acts in modern history.

120
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,361
Men, women, kids.
Kids like your boy down there.

121
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:52,322
Blown to bits.
Slaughtered in cold blood.

122
00:23:53,376 --> 00:24:00,625
Did you join the Navy to protect
your country from her enemies?

123
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:04,881
Carlos is one
of her biggest enemies today.

124
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:10,097
As terrorism is a growth industry,
he's a bigger enemy every day.

125
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:13,852
Why are you telling me all this?

126
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:22,612
Most of the free world has been
after Carlos for the past ten years.

127
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:28,903
And they have come up with nothing.
There is only one way to get him.

128
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:37,125
There is exactly one person,
in the whole world, who can get him.

129
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,422
- How the hell would I get him?
- You'll need to think it over.

130
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:51,471
The answer's no.
I was trained as a naval officer.

131
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:58,183
You came to the wrong address.
The man you're looking for is Bond.

132
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:04,899
James Bond. He lives in England,
drives an Aston Martin. Go see him.

133
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:11,287
Admiral Crawford, this is
Commander and Mrs. Ward Scowcroft.

134
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:18,126
I know your family well. I was
with your father at the Academy.

135
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,503
I won't let you down, sir.

136
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:26,387
Lt. Commander
and Mrs. Annibal Ramirez.

137
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,263
- Annabelle..?
- Annibal, sir.

138
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:35,522
I'm glad to see we're getting some
Mexican-American officers.

139
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:41,032
I'm an L.A. boy myself.
I have a soft spot for Mexican food.

140
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:48,826
- My stomach doesn't always agree.
- We eat Cuban food.

141
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:53,043
I think your stomach
would find that more agreeable.

142
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:58,039
- You're Cuban-Americans?
- Yes, sir.

143
00:25:58,217 --> 00:26:04,551
- If he can't appreciate that...
- It's okay, don't worry.

144
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:09,884
His wife asked me to mow her lawn,
so we'll always have food.

145
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:16,812
This is a coincidence. I was over at
your lovely house the other day, -

146
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:22,361
- but I had to leave suddenly and
never got to make your acquaintance.

147
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:25,986
The pleasure is mine.

148
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:32,831
- Shaw. Jack Shaw.
- Senor Shaw. Mucho gusto.

149
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:37,167
My wife speaks English.
So do l.

150
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:44,009
I should have realized you'd feel
embarrassed speaking Spanish here.

151
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:49,391
Who is he?

152
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:57,940
- A white wine and a club soda.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:26:58,113 --> 00:27:01,732
Let me guess,
the wine is for your wife?

154
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:08,528
You're afraid to loosen up
in front of the brass.

155
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:13,833
How can you stand this shit?
They're all so fucking constipated.

156
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:21,301
- My wife is waiting for her soda.
- There's a fiery retort!

157
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:31,140
- How about "fuck you, pal"?
- I'd believe it, if it was louder.

158
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:40,112
You don't belong with these guys.
You belong to me.

159
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:44,067
Remember what Darth Vader said:
"Come over to the dark side."

160
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:49,073
Come over, Annibal. You have
no idea of the power we have.

161
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:55,503
I want nothing to do with you.
Get it through your thick skull.

162
00:27:55,674 --> 00:28:02,009
Your country came to you requesting
help and you turned it down.

163
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,678
Not exactly promotion material.
Know what I mean?

164
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:14,651
Are you threatening me? The answer
is no, and that is the end of it.

165
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:19,689
Now get a life.

166
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,237
That pest won't leave me alone.

167
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,914
Jesus Christ!

168
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,763
- What do you want?
- What time is it?

169
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:50,891
It's 1 :1 5. Precisely.

170
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:55,561
It's for you.

171
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:03,036
Hello?
Who the..?

172
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,913
Yes, sir.

173
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:15,337
Your wife and kid go to the store.
Carlos has been there first.

174
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:18,082
He's planted a bomb.

175
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:24,430
The boy you're going to see lived.
You tell me if he was lucky.

176
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:51,910
- Dr. Shaw, is this the specialist?
- Yes, Dr. Ramirez.

177
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:57,759
Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb
are the parents of the wounded boy.

178
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:04,512
Will you do the surgery? They
tell us you're the best there is.

179
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:09,431
He's the only one.
Here's the boy's chart, Doctor.

180
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:15,147
One kidney has been destroyed.
The left lung has been perforated.

181
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:22,238
The spleen, the large intestine
and stomach lining are all torn.

182
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:27,538
There are over
1 00 individual pieces of shrapnel.

183
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:35,801
It's a trademark device of Carlos'.
Designed not to kill but to maim.

184
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:45,384
You're a sadistic son of a bitch.

185
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:52,360
You used those poor people. You'd
use anything to get what you want.

186
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:56,608
To get what I want?
Let me show you what I want.

187
00:30:56,782 --> 00:31:02,369
There's some photographs in there
of some of Carlos' victims.

188
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:08,873
Until you came along, all we could
do was take pictures of his victims.

189
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:17,469
I told them you were the only one.
It's true. We got a good doctor...

190
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:20,923
But you are the only one
who can get the Jackal.

191
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:27,096
I'm not the bad guy, Annibal.
Carlos is.

192
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,865
Go talk to him.

193
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:33,998
- Take care of your mother.
- Why do you have to go?

194
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:38,091
Because I finally got my chance
to go into subs.

195
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:42,642
Why can't somebody else's daddy
go into subs, and you can stay here?

196
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:47,971
Because I'm the one they chose.
And because your dad can do the job.

197
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,773
Listen to me, no whining, okay?

198
00:32:57,451 --> 00:33:01,319
Bye, sweetie.

199
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:06,366
Are you going to miss me?

200
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,592
- Bye, sweetie.
- Take care.

201
00:34:03,438 --> 00:34:08,396
This is an ad hoc operation set up
specifically for your mission.

202
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:12,518
From here on, your name is Miguel.

203
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:17,075
- Miguel?
- That's security.

204
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:20,945
So your name
isn't really Jack Shaw?

205
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:23,199
Of course it is.

206
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:29,162
Nice place.

207
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,840
Yes, there's a toilet in every room.

208
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:38,467
- Your mother is lrish-American?
- Yes, she is.

209
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:44,063
That's how come the blue eyes.
Something wrong, Miguel?

210
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:46,639
No.

211
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:51,230
Your father was in a Cuban prison.
Is that correct?

212
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:57,526
- That's correct, sir.
- Your mother took you to visit him.

213
00:34:57,703 --> 00:35:01,238
I see
you've done your homework, sir.

214
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:08,541
Miguel, no one is supposed to know
you are anything but a student.

215
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:14,136
Don't call me sir. It's like a sign
on your forehead that says military.

216
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:21,719
- From here on out, forget the Navy.
- Yes, sir. Sire.

217
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:27,274
Okay, I've got you.

218
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:43,919
This is a satellite tracking centre.
If Carlos ever uncovers our plot, -

219
00:35:44,086 --> 00:35:48,664
- he will try to find a way
to kill us first.

220
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:56,798
Carlos has two main safe houses.
One in Libya, one in East Germany.

221
00:35:56,974 --> 00:36:03,594
Our satellites pass over three times
a day. The Russians know when.

222
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:07,723
So we have to assume
Carlos knows as well.

223
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:11,900
There's another fella here
I want you to meet.

224
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:16,700
Although I think
you're already acquainted.

225
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:29,464
- What the fuck is this?
- Hello. My name's Amos.

226
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:34,135
I didn't recognize you without
my foot chained to the floor.

227
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:41,139
- I hope there are no hard feelings.
- There are a lot of hard feelings.

228
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:44,563
You're going to be hearing
from my lawyer.

229
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:50,688
Outside of myself,
he's the most important person here.

230
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:56,239
We're working with the lsraelis.
Amos has studied Carlos.

231
00:36:56,412 --> 00:37:04,207
- He took the photo in Libya.
- Why didn't you just kill him?

232
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:08,708
Don't let this equipment fool you.
Carlos has the home court advantage.

233
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:12,751
He has three layers of protection
at all times.

234
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,971
Next, and most importantly,
anyone who hits Carlos -

235
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:24,182
- will unleash against himself
a fanatical wave of terrorism.

236
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,732
- Fanatical.
- Okay.

237
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:34,734
That, by the way, is the last
question you're going to ask.

238
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:41,413
From here on, you get information
when we want you to get it.

239
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:46,496
You don't ask questions.
You just do as you're told.

240
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:57,260
This won't be like the Navy.
We'll push you to the limit.

241
00:37:57,435 --> 00:38:03,972
Fatigue, frustration, fear.
You're going to be terrified.

242
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,358
- When do we start?
- We already have.

243
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:15,862
What were the names on the last
three tombstones on your right?

244
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:23,080
- I don't know. I wasn't looking.
- Guillaume, Gautier, Smith.

245
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:28,249
Carlos is always looking.
Always paying attention.

246
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:40,060
Carlos is the master of the survival
techniques we will teach you.

247
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:49,318
For him there are no rules, but you
are a rules follower, aren't you?

248
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,274
- If you say so.
- If you say so.

249
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:57,830
Carlos is the opposite.
That's what makes it so seductive.

250
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:04,038
He can kill whomever he chooses.
He can take whatever he chooses.

251
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:08,164
It is to be, in many ways,
a superman.

252
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:13,504
If you can learn what we can teach
you, you could be one of them, too.

253
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:18,475
If you don't,
you're going to be one of them.

254
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:22,232
Another dead soldier.

255
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,919
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

256
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:58,015
- How's the porridge. You like it?
- It's okay. Not bad.

257
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,474
Finish everything in the pot.

258
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:13,656
- There's eight or nine helpings.
- No questions. Just do.

259
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:26,584
Remember not only the names,
but the positions of the stones.

260
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:31,552
When I call out a name,
you whirl and shoot.

261
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:36,800
- It's fucking freezing.
- Brisson!

262
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:44,026
- Can I get some gloves?
- No luxuries. Dupres!

263
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:52,782
You get comfortable,
you'll get killed. Pacquet!

264
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:02,372
Reload.

265
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:10,513
Go.

266
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,928
Time.

267
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:23,268
Top shelf: Milk, juice,
maybe some cottage cheese.

268
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:28,439
A couple of beers. Tomatoes.
I don't know what else.

269
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:34,785
What kind of milk? Was it opened
or closed? What kind of cheese?

270
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:39,868
How many beers and tomatoes?
This is life and death.

271
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:44,506
The cupboard over the stove.
You've got four seconds.

272
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:47,510
Look this time.

273
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:54,599
Go.

274
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:57,640
Time.

275
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:14,536
- Name and place of birth?
- lllich Ramirez Sanchez.

276
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:18,325
- Caracas, Venezuela.
- Father?

277
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:22,547
Dr. Jose Altagracia Ramirez Sanchez.

278
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:28,426
- Must you smoke that cigar?
- Yes.

279
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:36,181
Carlos' father abandoned his family
because he wanted to be a playboy.

280
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:40,851
Your father abandoned you
when he was sent to jail.

281
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:45,735
Either way,
it's lonely boy missing his father.

282
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:52,656
Use your own experiences to create
an image of Carlos' father.

283
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,496
So when you talk about him
you have the same emotion.

284
00:42:56,668 --> 00:43:00,251
The same love.
The same resentment.

285
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:06,340
The same sadness.

286
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,843
The same anger.

287
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:14,637
So who told you to stop?

288
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:20,597
- What's that?
- A transmitter.

289
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:25,771
- For what?
- Target practice. You're the target.

290
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:55,687
Jose! Bouvier!

291
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:58,429
Smith!

292
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:41,644
You're dead.

293
00:44:56,252 --> 00:45:01,543
- You've finished all your porridge.
- I've finished all my porridge.

294
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:05,086
Good.

295
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:08,880
You can have some more.

296
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:18,151
- I ain't eating any more shit.
- Whatever is the matter?

297
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:24,356
I'll tell you what the matter is.
I've been here eight fucking weeks!

298
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:28,482
All I've had to eat the whole time
is this shit.

299
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:33,324
I'm losing weight.
I'm shitting 3-4 times a day.

300
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,712
You nearly killed me
with those snowmobiles.

301
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,957
It's Christmas Eve, and I haven't
seen my family in two months.

302
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:47,632
And I still don't know what I'm
supposed to be learning here.

303
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:54,059
- You're acting like a spoiled brat.
- Which is going to save your life.

304
00:45:54,230 --> 00:46:01,147
Acting like a tight-ass Navy brass
is exactly what will get you killed.

305
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:06,446
As a child, Carlos was fed porridge.
He hated it.

306
00:46:06,618 --> 00:46:14,330
Everyone he's ever been close to
he told about that porridge.

307
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:21,715
In school he was a scrawny kid.
He felt clumsy.

308
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:28,718
- We made you feel clumsy.
- Carlos' father smoked cigars.

309
00:46:28,892 --> 00:46:36,022
The cover that will save your life
is one you believe in yourself.

310
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:38,979
Ready for the next test?

311
00:46:40,905 --> 00:46:45,234
Your wife has told you she was away
from the house for a week.

312
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:48,327
Now you come home together.

313
00:46:49,247 --> 00:46:55,997
Walk through the house. Don't arouse
her suspicion. You have 30 seconds.

314
00:46:56,171 --> 00:47:05,508
Find out if she's lying. Then we'll
answer some of your questions.

315
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:21,651
- Time's up.
- Is she telling the truth?

316
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:25,951
- She had a man over.
- How do you know?

317
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,161
She hasn't been here for a week?
The sponge is still wet.

318
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:38,297
There's water under the dish rack.
The milk is fresh.

319
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:41,882
From the date on it,
it was probably bought yesterday.

320
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:47,296
- Same with the margarine and bread.
- How do you know it was a man?

321
00:47:47,475 --> 00:47:53,810
She might have met him at a bar.
A book of matches was thrown out.

322
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:58,395
- There was ash from a cigarette.
- What else?

323
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:07,076
I think they made love on the sofa.
The cushions were hastily turned.

324
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:16,499
I know it was a man
from the smell of cheap aftershave.

325
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:20,256
Jack, you've been fucking my wife.

326
00:48:55,422 --> 00:49:01,792
Rousseau! Bouvier!
Flint! Brisson!

327
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:13,063
Not bad, huh?

328
00:49:14,192 --> 00:49:18,521
The plan is to get the KGB
to eliminate Carlos for us.

329
00:49:18,696 --> 00:49:25,827
Carlos knows all the links between
the KGB and terrorist organizations.

330
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,285
He knows everything.

331
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:34,330
If we can get the KGB to think that
Carlos is going over to the ClA, -

332
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:38,419
- they'll take him out for us.

333
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:48,800
- Why would they think that?
- Money. $50 million.

334
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:56,025
Not for revolution, for his pocket.
A new identity and ClA protection.

335
00:49:56,194 --> 00:50:00,442
If we lay it out right,
they'll believe it.

336
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:04,993
- When do we move?
- Not so fast. You're not ready.

337
00:50:05,162 --> 00:50:11,415
- I'd say at least two months...
- Two months? Are you crazy?

338
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:18,383
Bullshit! I'm ready now.

339
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:25,639
You give me any test you want,
I'll pass it.

340
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:31,774
I've already passed all your tests.
No wonder you haven't caught him.

341
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:38,822
You've had me training in Siberia
to catch someone in the Middle East!

342
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:56,506
- How long does it take to work?
- It should be hitting him now.

343
00:51:22,744 --> 00:51:25,662
Carlos!

344
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:53,024
I told you I didn't want
anything to do with this.

345
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,657
Fuck you.

346
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:09,120
Are you looking for me, amigo?

347
00:52:35,154 --> 00:52:37,906
Father! Father!

348
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:49,832
- Hey, Joey.
- Pitch it to me.

349
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:56,091
- Watch!
- Joey, get out of there!

350
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,667
Ready?

351
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:14,645
- I hope we didn't go too far.
- The LSD might fuck him up.

352
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:18,901
It's better than being shot
in some back alley in Libya.

353
00:53:19,075 --> 00:53:24,616
If he can't handle this, he sure as
shit can't handle going operational.

354
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,669
What's next?

355
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:14,669
Your new instructor will be Carlos'
girlfriend from eight years ago.

356
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:20,679
She's French. Her name is Carla.
She'll teach you what we can't.

357
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:27,102
- Why is she helping us?
- Carlos used her.

358
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:31,769
He put her on an aeroplane
with a bomb in her suitcase.

359
00:54:31,944 --> 00:54:39,821
If it hadn't been found, she'd
have gone up with everything else.

360
00:54:39,994 --> 00:54:44,787
She's about 32.
She's very attractive.

361
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:50,035
- Yeah, it won't be a hardship.
- What won't be a hardship?

362
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:57,084
Doing it. Fucking her.

363
00:54:57,263 --> 00:55:04,760
Our way in is through another girl,
Agnieska. She's the key to the trap.

364
00:55:04,937 --> 00:55:11,474
The KGB will be watching her.
If she's convinced, so will they be.

365
00:55:12,028 --> 00:55:20,238
You'll then ask Agnieska
to do a bank transaction.

366
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:32,626
You're not cheating on your wife.
You're fucking for your flag.

367
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:37,094
Close your eyes
and think of England.

368
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:50,590
Hello?

369
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,979
The thing about Carlos is, he
doesn't lose himself with a woman.

370
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:17,652
Lovers are different to him.
He might have a use for them.

371
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:22,040
So he has to seduce them properly.

372
00:57:22,207 --> 00:57:27,285
Make sure they're so crazy for him
they'll do anything for him.

373
00:57:30,049 --> 00:57:34,711
It is not pleasure for him.

374
00:57:36,514 --> 00:57:40,559
It is a sick kind of conquest.

375
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:45,979
He'll do anything.

376
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:49,649
He's the perfect lover.

377
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:56,404
He doesn't do it to please you,
but to excite you.

378
00:57:56,577 --> 00:58:00,871
To make it dangerous for you...

379
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,916
The danger is very sexy
to a woman.

380
00:58:06,087 --> 00:58:10,465
He could kill you in a second,
but instead he makes you come.

381
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:28,230
It's like he makes you born again
the way he wants you to be.

382
00:58:29,237 --> 00:58:33,614
There isn't a thought in your brain
that he hasn't put there.

383
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:37,492
Not a feeling in your body
that he hasn't put there.

384
00:58:40,957 --> 00:58:44,326
You understand?

385
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,173
Take off your clothes.

386
00:58:57,058 --> 00:58:59,809
Just like that?

387
00:58:59,977 --> 00:59:05,648
Look... I don't want to know
your name or anything about you.

388
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:14,357
I'm not here to be romantic.
I'm here to help you kill him.

389
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:20,742
- I hope that's what you'll do.
- It is.

390
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:24,416
Take off your clothes.

391
01:00:28,237 --> 01:00:33,279
- You're smaller than him.
- Really...

392
01:00:34,994 --> 01:00:40,535
That's what he would have done
if I'd said something like that.

393
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:45,205
What's wrong with you?
Aren't you a man?

394
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:54,759
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

395
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:58,182
Come to me.

396
01:00:58,352 --> 01:01:01,472
Come, kiss where you hit.

397
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:19,199
Kiss where the blood is.
Smear it on my lip so I taste it.

398
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:31,970
Now go down on me.

399
01:01:40,355 --> 01:01:46,524
Don't let me come. Control me.

400
01:01:46,695 --> 01:01:50,444
It's got to be when he wants it.

401
01:01:52,118 --> 01:01:53,286
PARlS, SAME TlME

402
01:01:53,286 --> 01:01:56,203
PARlS, SAME TlME

403
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:30,111
The KGB has set up
a surveillance on Agnieska.

404
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:34,233
Agnieska has received word
from Carlos -

405
01:02:34,412 --> 01:02:39,371
- telling her to come and meet you.
You will convince her you're Carlos.

406
01:02:39,543 --> 01:02:46,459
Ask her to handle some banking, so
the KGB will know Carlos is Ortega.

407
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:52,755
When they see you with a ClA agent,
they'll know Carlos has turned.

408
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:59,136
Unless this Agnieska sees
through me. She was his lover.

409
01:02:59,314 --> 01:03:06,692
- She wasn't his wife.
- Carlos excites her.

410
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:12,653
She wants to believe you as a child
wants to believe in Santa Claus.

411
01:03:15,998 --> 01:03:21,787
- Where do I meet this Agnieska?
- Libya. That's where Carlos is.

412
01:03:23,297 --> 01:03:26,085
Libya?

413
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:28,584
Libya.

414
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:36,550
Jack doesn't know we're having this
talk, and I don't want him to know.

415
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:41,687
You're going to feel more alone
than you've ever felt in your life.

416
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:47,980
You'll think your heart's
going to jump out of your chest.

417
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:56,414
You'll suspect everyone.
I want you to be prepared for that.

418
01:03:56,582 --> 01:04:03,416
Understand?
Nothing prepares you.

419
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:10,388
You mustn't panic. You feel
the fear and you get rid of it.

420
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:15,134
Splash some water on your face
and look in the mirror.

421
01:04:15,311 --> 01:04:19,724
But when you do, make sure
it's Carlos you find there.

422
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:24,857
Then everyone else will see Carlos.
If anything goes wrong, -

423
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:28,149
- only Carlos can get you out.

424
01:04:46,635 --> 01:04:50,336
TRlPOLl, LlBYA, MAY 1 987

425
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:54,642
Passport.

426
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:10,858
- Ricardo Moran Vargas?
- Yes.

427
01:05:11,036 --> 01:05:15,497
- Your business?
- Oil. The petroleum business.

428
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,998
Petroleum?

429
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:17,410
Vladimir.

430
01:07:41,153 --> 01:07:47,192
One sound and you're dead.
Carlos, when is he coming here?

431
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:50,986
I don't know
what you're talking about.

432
01:07:51,164 --> 01:07:57,000
Don't play games with me.
We know you're going to meet him.

433
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:01,002
I don't know any Carlos.
I'm telling you the truth.

434
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:07,087
This gun has a silencer.
There will not be any noise.

435
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:12,468
- Now, talk.
- I don't know any Carlos.

436
01:08:12,645 --> 01:08:18,399
I just came to visit my girlfriend.
This is her apartment.

437
01:08:21,571 --> 01:08:28,534
- You're lying.
- I swear I'm telling the truth.

438
01:08:30,455 --> 01:08:33,789
Nice ass. Turn around.

439
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:41,006
- What are you going to do to me?
- Have some fun. Then...

440
01:08:49,016 --> 01:08:55,221
... I'll get something to eat,
because I'm famished.

441
01:08:57,609 --> 01:09:00,563
You bastard.

442
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:11,533
- I haven't seen you for two years.
- I wasn't sure I could trust you.

443
01:09:11,707 --> 01:09:15,575
And that cafe in Paris?

444
01:09:15,753 --> 01:09:20,665
That grenade didn't prove
you could trust me?

445
01:09:22,677 --> 01:09:28,051
That cafe in Paris
was a long time ago.

446
01:09:28,225 --> 01:09:35,224
Yes, but when I heard from you,
I came all the way out here.

447
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:40,275
I've been here for 24 hours.
Are you listening to me?

448
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:43,067
Listening.

449
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:59,413
You're different.

450
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:04,586
Tell me, who gave you permission
to go out?

451
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:11,596
You'll never change.
You'll never trust anybody.

452
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:16,349
I just wanted to go out
and get something to eat for us.

453
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:21,817
I have everything I want to eat
right in front of me.

454
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:43,965
- What do you think he's doing now?
- Practising safe sex, I hope.

455
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:56,357
Oh, my God!

456
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:03,940
Now, let's eat.

457
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:27,219
- What are you doing?
- Getting air. Don't be nervous.

458
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:49,321
- What do we have to eat?
- I found caviar and pate.

459
01:11:54,754 --> 01:12:01,007
- You didn't like the food I left?
- I couldn't eat a bite of it.

460
01:12:04,348 --> 01:12:07,219
I don't blame you.

461
01:12:07,393 --> 01:12:12,388
- Who smokes non-filters?
- What?

462
01:12:12,565 --> 01:12:18,520
- You don't smoke non-filters.
- What are you talking about?

463
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:28,112
- Non-filtered cigarettes!
- Listen...

464
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:35,253
I ran out of cigarettes, and l
bummed a cigarette at the cafe.

465
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:39,752
- You bummed a cigarette?
- With coffee I need a cigarette.

466
01:12:39,927 --> 01:12:45,800
Okay.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

467
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:55,942
The nearest cafe is two blocks away.
A cigarette wouldn't last that long.

468
01:12:56,111 --> 01:13:03,158
You bummed a cigarette in this
apartment. This door was a signal.

469
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:10,326
Wasn't it, you bitch?
Who did you meet with?

470
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:19,552
- I'll kill you! Who was it?
- The French Secret Service. DST.

471
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:17,006
Get out!

472
01:19:53,802 --> 01:19:59,592
Carlos, we have to talk.
There's been a shooting tonight.

473
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:01,843
A shooting?

474
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:09,482
What kind of intelligence is this?

475
01:20:09,652 --> 01:20:14,362
How the fuck could you not know
she was working for the French?

476
01:20:14,533 --> 01:20:21,948
They didn't tell us about it.
We didn't tell them about you.

477
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:27,285
You were beautiful. The Russians
must be convinced that was Carlos.

478
01:20:27,463 --> 01:20:35,340
Work up a scenario for the girl.
Carlos would have killed her.

479
01:20:35,513 --> 01:20:39,891
The Russians saw the DST. They
know they were there to get Carlos.

480
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:46,679
The French made it perfect for us.
The KGB now think you're Carlos.

481
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:53,277
You fucking maniac!
Jack, I killed four men.

482
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:58,526
- Annibal...
- Just a second!

483
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:04,577
- I don't like killing our allies!
- Policemen get killed. It happens.

484
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:12,629
I'd rather have you feeling guilty
than them feeling guilty about you.

485
01:21:12,802 --> 01:21:20,430
You did what you had to do. Carlos
couldn't have done any better.

486
01:21:23,272 --> 01:21:27,815
Agnieska betray me?

487
01:21:27,985 --> 01:21:34,190
I don't believe it. This woman
was so in love with me -

488
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:39,658
- that if I asked her to suck
my uncle's dick she would do it.

489
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:45,288
- She was seen, Carlos.
- Where is she now?

490
01:21:45,462 --> 01:21:48,796
They've taken her to Paris.

491
01:21:48,966 --> 01:21:52,964
I want that bitch dead.

492
01:21:53,846 --> 01:22:00,679
You handle it. Hit her in Paris,
right under their fucking noses.

493
01:22:01,687 --> 01:22:06,895
- When?
- Leave now! Right now!

494
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:10,235
Don't forget to leave Europe
through London.

495
01:22:12,532 --> 01:22:15,699
Something else troubles me.

496
01:22:19,581 --> 01:22:24,789
You're the only ones
who knew about this safe house.

497
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:30,004
So which one of you
was her contact?

498
01:22:30,176 --> 01:22:34,256
I know it wasn't you, my friend,
we go way back.

499
01:23:41,793 --> 01:23:47,215
- Is this seat taken?
- No, go right ahead.

500
01:23:52,012 --> 01:23:59,558
- I'm going home to my family.
- This is not the time for this.

501
01:23:59,729 --> 01:24:04,474
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
I'm going home.

502
01:24:06,277 --> 01:24:10,690
You said we can't move again
till he leaves Libya.

503
01:24:10,866 --> 01:24:15,492
- He might stay there for a year.
- No, he won't.

504
01:24:15,662 --> 01:24:23,374
He's going to make a move in Europe.
I'll confirm our connections.

505
01:24:59,542 --> 01:25:02,709
A pack of Marlboro, please.

506
01:25:09,594 --> 01:25:13,010
What are you doing here?

507
01:25:13,181 --> 01:25:18,520
Buying cigarettes.
What are you doing here?

508
01:25:21,774 --> 01:25:26,317
Excuse me. I only wanted to know
where I can get a newspaper.

509
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,031
Idiot. Right in front of you.

510
01:25:34,245 --> 01:25:41,577
Never address me in public.
Wait for me by the phone booth.

511
01:25:41,753 --> 01:25:48,468
Excuse me. I asked if you knew
where I can get a newspaper.

512
01:25:51,388 --> 01:25:56,727
You make the slightest move
and I shoot.

513
01:25:56,894 --> 01:26:01,391
Now walk to the restroom
very carefully.

514
01:26:35,268 --> 01:26:38,851
Tell me what I want to know,
or you're dead.

515
01:26:39,022 --> 01:26:41,809
I don't know...

516
01:27:00,086 --> 01:27:03,289
Who you are?

517
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:08,168
Down.

518
01:27:26,197 --> 01:27:29,732
Get out of here, now.

519
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:36,785
I won't let you die here.
I still have a lawsuit against you.

520
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:40,908
My dear boy...

521
01:27:41,088 --> 01:27:45,750
My dear boy... I am dead.

522
01:27:45,926 --> 01:27:51,003
Please God,
don't let it all be for nothing.

523
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:58,643
- Get out now!
- I'll get you some help.

524
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:24,587
Shaw. I was wondering
what the status was of the account.

525
01:28:24,759 --> 01:28:28,342
Is it still open?

526
01:28:32,559 --> 01:28:36,426
Yeah...

527
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:54,871
It's off. The director wants
an operational review board.

528
01:28:55,041 --> 01:29:02,788
- He asked me about a newspaper...
- Shut up.

529
01:29:02,966 --> 01:29:08,043
You should have shot him,
but you didn't have a gun.

530
01:29:08,221 --> 01:29:11,176
There wasn't anything you could do.

531
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:15,977
It was a password. Anything you said
would have backfired.

532
01:29:16,147 --> 01:29:20,560
I had the same thing once. "Awfully
warm for this time of year."

533
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:26,026
The reply was, "Yes, but not
as sticky as two summers ago."

534
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:33,412
"Not as sticky as two summers ago."
Anything else, he even hesitates, -

535
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:36,915
- I shoot him.

536
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:42,376
I shot him. Just like the Jap
was going to do to you.

537
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:48,553
Bad luck for Amos.
Bad luck for us.

538
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:53,180
You and me, we're out of here.

539
01:29:55,396 --> 01:29:59,809
- Just like that?
- I'm not the Madam, kid.

540
01:29:59,985 --> 01:30:07,067
I'm just one of the whores.
So are you.

541
01:30:23,009 --> 01:30:27,470
- Dad, you're home!
- Hi, Joey.

542
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:32,844
Look who's back.

543
01:30:44,615 --> 01:30:47,652
Come on, I've got stuff to show you.

544
01:31:06,889 --> 01:31:09,380
Stop it.

545
01:31:09,558 --> 01:31:12,974
Annibal, stop it.

546
01:31:13,813 --> 01:31:17,431
What?

547
01:31:19,068 --> 01:31:24,525
- What is it?
- You've been with another woman.

548
01:31:28,328 --> 01:31:31,779
What the hell made you say that?

549
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:44,006
You're different.

550
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:51,055
I was on a submarine. There aren't
any women on submarines.

551
01:31:52,812 --> 01:31:58,981
- Okay.
- This is nice to come home to!

552
01:31:59,152 --> 01:32:03,446
We didn't have shore leave.
You can check with the fucking Navy.

553
01:32:03,615 --> 01:32:09,155
I don't need to check.
And don't talk to me like that.

554
01:32:10,122 --> 01:32:14,868
Where are you going?
Have you started smoking again?

555
01:32:15,044 --> 01:32:18,745
Yeah, I'll be doing heroin soon.

556
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:27,546
- You remember what to do?
- Keep my eye on the ball.

557
01:32:27,724 --> 01:32:35,221
And who's the guy that wins?
Whoever has the most fun wins.

558
01:32:36,191 --> 01:32:43,856
Tyler, I'm not talking just for fun.
You go out there and you focus.

559
01:32:44,033 --> 01:32:49,194
- Hey, pal, lighten up.
- What did you say?

560
01:32:49,372 --> 01:32:53,915
Lighten up. It's just a game.
He's just a kid.

561
01:32:54,085 --> 01:32:58,249
He's my kid,
so why don't you go fuck yourself.

562
01:33:00,884 --> 01:33:07,005
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- I might be looking at a dead man.

563
01:33:07,182 --> 01:33:11,512
- Annibal, let's go sit down.
- Annibelle, that's a lovely name.

564
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:18,401
Take a walk, Tinkerbell.
Play some ball. Get with the team.

565
01:33:52,981 --> 01:33:56,397
Annibelle Ramirez.

566
01:33:58,945 --> 01:34:01,946
Annibal.

567
01:34:02,783 --> 01:34:06,401
Wait.

568
01:34:19,509 --> 01:34:22,712
He's all yours.

569
01:34:23,555 --> 01:34:28,894
Little League.
It's a tough game.

570
01:34:34,942 --> 01:34:40,447
- What are you doing here?
- It's showtime, sweetheart.

571
01:34:47,288 --> 01:34:53,374
He's planning another attack.
He's on his way back to East Berlin.

572
01:34:53,545 --> 01:35:00,461
I need some time to think.
I nearly killed somebody today.

573
01:35:00,636 --> 01:35:06,472
- I don't know about this anymore.
- Baseball dads deserve no better.

574
01:35:06,642 --> 01:35:12,763
I heard he was way out of line.
You think Carlos has turned sweet?

575
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:20,901
Don't tell me about Carlos.
I know exactly who Carlos is.

576
01:35:21,074 --> 01:35:26,151
I'm saying that maybe there's
something more important to me.

577
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:31,490
Like getting back to being me
and not some fucking maniac.

578
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:39,792
You want to get back to being you?
Then finish it. Kill him.

579
01:35:39,969 --> 01:35:44,631
When he's dead, it's over with.
You're walking around with his face.

580
01:35:44,807 --> 01:35:48,176
Sooner or later,
one of the bad guys will see it.

581
01:35:48,353 --> 01:35:54,059
Next time there won't be any Amos
to take a bullet for you.

582
01:35:54,234 --> 01:36:00,355
Help me get him, because you'll
never know if he'll come after you.

583
01:36:01,825 --> 01:36:08,243
Listen to me, I don't
have any family or any friends.

584
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:14,457
The only people that ever mattered
to me were the ones that I killed.

585
01:36:16,215 --> 01:36:21,458
And you. Yeah, you.

586
01:36:23,473 --> 01:36:29,393
I created you. I won't just
let you walk away like that.

587
01:36:29,563 --> 01:36:34,142
You didn't create me.
You infected me with your poison.

588
01:36:35,736 --> 01:36:42,984
I know that the kid in the hospital
was a set-up.

589
01:36:44,746 --> 01:36:50,618
You're going to get him for me.
Goddamn, you're going to get him!

590
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:56,166
Or I swear to God
I'll make sure he knows about you.

591
01:36:56,341 --> 01:37:01,383
I'll use you
and your family for bait!

592
01:37:03,557 --> 01:37:09,393
- You do and I'll kill you.
- You want to try killing me?

593
01:37:09,563 --> 01:37:13,182
You want to know who Carlos is?
Look in the mirror.

594
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:19,149
You've got a Carlos problem.
That's the guy you've got to get.

595
01:37:19,324 --> 01:37:26,702
That's what it's all about.
You and your family or the Jackal.

596
01:37:41,389 --> 01:37:50,393
You're not going back to those subs.
It's changed you. You need help.

597
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:54,943
- Maybe a stress disability.
- Shut up.

598
01:37:55,112 --> 01:38:00,451
No. I want the man I married,
not the animal who's standing here.

599
01:38:00,617 --> 01:38:05,493
Where is he? Because I don't want
to be married to who you are now.

600
01:38:05,664 --> 01:38:12,462
The kids deserve their father back.
I deserve my husband back.

601
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:19,048
- Whatever it is about your job...
- What do you think my job is?

602
01:38:22,474 --> 01:38:26,851
What do you think is out there?

603
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:33,308
A nice world with shopping malls,
Little League and ballet?

604
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:44,069
People are killing out there. I'm
one of them. I've murdered people.

605
01:38:44,247 --> 01:38:52,207
Not with a missile from a sub, but
so their brains splattered on me.

606
01:38:58,011 --> 01:39:02,638
And they weren't even the enemy.
They were allies.

607
01:39:02,808 --> 01:39:08,894
But I couldn't blow my cover.
I've killed men. I let a friend die.

608
01:39:09,065 --> 01:39:12,813
I betrayed everything
I've ever believed in.

609
01:39:17,073 --> 01:39:20,573
And you were right.

610
01:39:23,747 --> 01:39:27,448
I fucked other women.

611
01:39:30,838 --> 01:39:37,671
You know what's worse? I've made
you and the children a target.

612
01:39:38,638 --> 01:39:45,554
There is someone that will kill you,
if I don't kill him first.

613
01:39:45,728 --> 01:39:53,025
That's my job, Maura, and if you
don't mind, I'm late for work.

614
01:41:11,903 --> 01:41:14,821
Thank you.

615
01:43:08,943 --> 01:43:12,028
Not till he's dead, Jack.

616
01:43:17,536 --> 01:43:20,703
Shit.

617
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,736
Don't blow it, comrades.

618
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:28,290
Shit!

619
01:46:21,021 --> 01:46:28,732
- Carlos, you will come with us.
- Who are you, KGB?

620
01:46:28,905 --> 01:46:33,614
What's the problem?
We have an agreement.

621
01:46:33,785 --> 01:46:40,784
You thought we were from your friend
at the ClA? Henry Fields.

622
01:46:40,959 --> 01:46:47,461
- Henry Fields?
- Get dressed. You, don't move.

623
01:46:55,766 --> 01:47:01,188
Go ahead, but you'd better
have a good explanation.

624
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,737
Give me my pants!

625
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:24,419
That's what was going on in Libya.
The ClA and the DST.

626
01:47:24,588 --> 01:47:30,342
They're trying to set you up,
and you're falling for it.

627
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:36,550
- I'd like to know your sources.
- We have proof.

628
01:47:38,269 --> 01:47:46,064
You'll be pleading for my
forgiveness before this is over.

629
01:47:49,907 --> 01:47:55,114
Okay, you want to go?
Let's go.

630
01:47:55,287 --> 01:48:01,706
I want to be interrogated.
I demand to be interrogated...

631
01:48:21,273 --> 01:48:24,892
I've got you, you piece of shit.

632
01:48:48,969 --> 01:48:54,556
- Who are you?
- I'm you, motherfucker.

633
01:49:32,223 --> 01:49:35,675
Now you eat shit
and die slow, amigo.

634
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:53,947
Hi, you want a light?

635
01:49:58,668 --> 01:50:01,337
Annibal?

636
01:50:09,387 --> 01:50:14,595
"Awfully warm for this time of year,
isn't it?"

637
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:23,105
"Not as sticky
as two summers ago."

638
01:50:28,825 --> 01:50:31,992
Annibal...

639
01:50:32,162 --> 01:50:37,618
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- He's getting away. Go after him.

640
01:50:37,793 --> 01:50:42,087
Fuck him. He's not going anywhere.
It's over, we won.

641
01:50:44,133 --> 01:50:48,427
Jack, I had him.

642
01:50:50,347 --> 01:50:54,677
Come on. Lift up.

643
01:50:54,852 --> 01:51:02,350
You did it. The Russians bought it.
They think Carlos is a traitor.

644
01:51:02,527 --> 01:51:06,607
His terrorist days are over.
No place is safe for him.

645
01:51:06,781 --> 01:51:14,872
His friends will give him up,
and when they do, we'll be there.

646
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:41,817
- Maura, we're going to be late.
- They're waiting in the car.

647
01:51:41,985 --> 01:51:45,437
I'll call you back.

648
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,485
I promise. Okay, goodbye.

649
01:51:59,587 --> 01:52:03,585
- Maura.
- Okay, I'm coming.

650
01:52:20,735 --> 01:52:25,278
How does one begin to comprehend
a tragedy like this?

651
01:52:25,448 --> 01:52:31,284
An officer returns home after
six months of hazardous duty.

652
01:52:31,454 --> 01:52:37,789
He and his family are off to church,
and in an instant they are no more.

653
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:41,959
Our minds cannot grasp
the horror of this tragedy.

654
01:52:42,132 --> 01:52:46,794
There is only faith.
An undying faith in the Almighty.

655
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:55,227
Even though we cannot see it,
there is a plan.

656
01:53:09,411 --> 01:53:12,198
Now you're free.

657
01:53:27,138 --> 01:53:34,221
Bonjour, Monsieur Mendoza.
Special delivery.

658
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:44,109
It's going to be hot today.

659
01:54:14,021 --> 01:54:17,722
Dad, come on.
